?????, Folk 
Both mathematics and dance are languages that use symbols to convey ideas 
and expressions. Mathematics uses written symbols to represent abstrac- 
tions so that users can arrive at a greater understanding of a problem with- 
out ambiguity. Dancers use abstract symbols to represent thoughts, 
feelings, emotions, and ideas, and these symbols may be interpreted in mul- 
tiple ways. Both disciplines rely to a large extent on pattern recognition. 
Many forms of dance, such as classical ballet, involve complex patterns 
and take years of practice to master. Yet other forms of dance use everyday 
movements with more simplistic patterns. For example, folk dances have 
evolved from common movements of work and play. 
Although folk dances require concentration and focus, their use of every- 
day movement invites observers to participate. Similarly, mathematics can 
be studied at the basic level of arithmetic, which is used to make simple 
transactions and to understand how things work. More advanced mathe- 
matics, such as calculus, chaos theory, or abstract algebra require years 
to master. 
Discreteness in Mathematics and Dance 
Many dances are based on a simple method of counting and discrete se- 
quences, which enables participants to recognize and learn a variety of 
dances. The word "discrete" also has a common, similar usage in mathe- 
matics. Discrete mathematics involves counting separate elements, such as 
the number of arrangements of letters on a license place, or the number of 
ways that a presidential candidate can visit all fifty states. Solutions in dis- 
crete mathematics can be only whole units. Discrete math is therefore one 
of the most accessible areas of modern mathematics since many of the ques- 
tions are easy for anyone to understand. 
Contradancing. Contradancing is a popular form of folk dance in the 
United States that illustrates the mathematics of dance. Its origins go back 
to colonial days, and its roots can be traced to English country dances. 
Contradancing, which shares elements of traditional square dancing, is 
a form of set dancing in which a dancer's position relative to another dancer 
traces patterns on the dance floor. As in most dancing, timing is crucial, as 
is the ability to rapidly carry out called instructions.

can be very structured.

array of data in rows

arrangement of order- 
ing, of items in a set 
Music for contradancing is highly structured. Everything occurs in mul- 
tiples of four. In one common format, the band plays a tune for sixteen 
beats, repeats the tune, then plays a new tune for sixteen beats and repeats. 
An eight-beat section is known as a call, during which each block of four 
dancers executes a called-out instruction. 
When contradancers line up in their groups of four to produce a long 
column "down" the dance floor (extending away from the band), each 
square block of two couples can be thought of as a mathematical matrix 
with the dimension 2X2. Each dancer, or element of the matrix, is in a 
specific position within the array. The called instructions correspond to re- 
arrangements of the elements (dancers). After sixty-four beats, for exam- 
ple, the first and second rows of the matrix may be interchanged. Of course, 
this could be done in one step, but the fun of dancing comes from per- 
forming the various permutations by which groups of four can reach the 
end result. 
There are many called instructions in contradancing, ranging in com- 
plexity from simply circling once around to the left or right within each 
group of four to sequences of moves that involve exchanging partners or 
stepping one-quarter, one-half, or three-quarters of the way around the ring. 
With each call, the matrix representing four dancers changes. In the final 
configuration, the two rows of the original 2x2 matrix may be inter- 
changed, or they may be the same as when the dance started. 
Data Analyst 
Chaos Theory and Dance 
Computer scientists have applied the basics of chaos theory to generate vari- 
ations on dance movement sequences. Special symbols represent human 
body postures, and positions for each of the body's main joints are encoded 
by defining an axis and angle of rotation given in the form of a mathe- 
matical expression called a quaternion. A motion sequence is then mapped 
onto a chaotic attractor. Following a new trajectory around the attractor 
produces a variation of the original motion sequence. To smooth out abrupt 
transitions introduced by the chaotic mapping, the researchers have devel- 
oped schemes that capture and enforce particular dance styles, see also 
Chaos, Mathematics of.

Data Analyst 
A data analyst does more than simply analyze information. Data are col- 
lected for a variety of reasons—to learn about something new, to find rela- 
tionships and generate statistics, or to create information databases. 
Likewise, there are numerous fields of study that collect data, such as fi- 
nance, medicine, sales and marketing, and engineering, to name a few. All 
this data needs to be correlated into useful and relevant information. 
When a data analyst faces a printout of numbers or facts, he or she must 
make sense of it all. First, a data analyst will determine where the data came 
from, if anything has corrupted the collection, and if more data is needed. 
As data is sorted, the analyst needs to find relationships among the data, se- 
lect samples that are indicative of the whole, convert data from one form to 
another, and even predict results. In short, the analyst helps make the data 
useful. 
Data analysts may also summarize the data in a report and communi- 
cate this information to colleagues or the public. Sometimes data analysts 
maintain routine records in a database or archive data for future use and 
analysis. Those data analysts with more advanced computer and engineer- 
ing training may be called upon to design programs or models that collect 
data, calibrate instruments that run tests, or troubleshoot systems that are 
not functioning properly. 
THE COMMUNICATION OF 
MATHEMATICS AND 
DANCE 
According to Keith Devlin in The 
Language of Mathematics, 
mathematics seeks to communi- 
cate a sense of what humans 
experience. The simplicity, preci- 
sion, purity, and elegance of 
mathematical expressions and 
patterns give mathematics an 
aesthetic value. The mathemati- 
cal connections to dance simi- 
larly give dancers a creative, 
aesthetic, and interpretive 
means of expressing the human 
experience.

Mathematics and computer programming are essential skills for data an- 
alysts. The most important math skills are strong knowledge of statistics 
and statistical analysis, since a data analyst will often be asked whether a set 
of data is statistically significant. Data analysts must also have the computer 
skills necessary to operate a wide variety of databases, see also Data Col- 
lection and Interpretation.

Data Collection and Interpretation 
Data interpretation is part of daily life for most people. Interpretation is 
the process of making sense of numerical data that has been collected, an- 
alyzed, and presented. People interpret data when they turn on the televi- 
sion and hear the news anchor reporting on a poll, when they read 
advertisements claiming that one product is better than another, or when 
they choose grocery store items that claim they are more effective than 
other leading brands. 
A common method of assessing numerical data is known as statistical 
analysis, and the activity of analyzing and interpreting data in order to make 
predictions is known as inferential statistics. Informed consumers recog- 
nize the importance of judging the reasonableness of data interpretations 
and predictions by considering sources of bias such as sampling procedures 
or misleading questions, margins of error, confidence intervals, and in- 
complete interpretations. 
Why Is Accurate Data Collection Important? 
The repercussions of inaccurate or improperly interpreted data are wide- 
ranging. For example, every 10 years a major census is done in the United 
States. The results are used to help determine the number of congressional 
seats that are assigned to each district; where new roads will be built; where 
new schools and libraries are needed; where new nursing homes, hospitals, 
and day care centers will be located; where new parks and recreational cen- 
ters will be built; and the sizes of police and fire departments. 
In the past 30 years there has been a major shift in the U.S. population. 
People have migrated from the northern states toward the southern states, 
and the result has been a major shift in congressional representation. With 
a net change of nearly 30 percent (a 17 percent drop in the Northeast and 
Midwest coupled with a 12 percent gain in the South), the South has gone 
from a position of less influence to one of greater influence in Congress as 
a result of population-based reapportionment. This is just one of many 
possible examples that reveal how data gathering and interpretation related 
to population can have a marked affect on the whole country. 
Gathering Reliable Data 
The process of data interpretation begins by gathering data. Because it is 
often difficult, or even impossible, to look at all the data (for example, to

audience must think criti- 
cally about both the data

the interpretation being 
offered by the presenter. 
poll every high school student in the United States), data are generally ob- 
tained from a smaller unit, a subset of the population known as a sample. 
Then data from the sample are used to predict (or infer) what the charac- 
teristics of the population as a whole may be. For example, a telephone sur- 
vey of one thousand car owners in the United States might be conducted 
to predict the popularity of various cars among all U.S. car owners. The one 
thousand U.S. car owners who are surveyed are the sample and all car own- 
ers in the United States are the population. 
But there both an art and science to collecting high-quality data. Sev- 
eral key elements must be considered: bias, sample size, question design, 
margin of error, and interpretation. 
Avoiding Bias. In order for data interpretation to be reliable, a number 
of factors must be in place. First and perhaps foremost, an unbiased sam- 
ple must be used. In other words, every person (or item) in the population 
should have an equal chance of being in the sample. 
For example, what if only Ford owners were surveyed in the telephone 
survey? The survey would be quite likely to show that Fords were more 
popular. A biased sample is likely to skew the data, thus making data in- 
terpretation unreliable. If we want to know what sorts of cars are preferred 
by U.S. car owners, we need to be sure that our sample of car owners is 
representative of the entire car owner population. 
One way of ensuring an unbiased sample is to choose randomly from the 
population. However, it is often difficult to design a study that will produce a 
truly unbiased sample. For example, suppose a surveyor decides to choose car 
owners at random to participate in a phone interview about car preferences. 
This may sound like a good plan, but car owners who do not have telephones 
or whose telephone numbers are unavailable will not have a chance to partic- 
ipate in the survey. Maybe car owners with unlisted telephone numbers have

selected subset of a

Data Collection and Interpretation 
BIAS IN NEWS CALL-IN 
POLLS 
Many news programs have call- 
in polls. The results of the poll 
are usually shown later in the 
program. This type of data col- 
lection is very unreliable 
because the information is 
coming from a biased sample. 
People who watch or listen to 
the news make up only a small 
percentage of the population. Of 
that group, only an even smaller 
percentage will call to offer their 
opinion. And of those who call, 
more are likely to disagree with 
the question because people 
with strong feelings against an 
issue are more likely to 
respond.

viewpoint instead of the 
whole population 
very different car preferences than the broader population, but we will never 
know if they are not included in the sample. 
Biased sampling continues to challenge census takers. In 1990, nearly 
35 percent of the households that were mailed census forms did not mail 
them back. If a form is not returned, the Census Bureau must send some- 
one to the person's house. Even with census takers visiting homes door to 
door, the Census Bureau was still unable to contact one out of every five of 
the families who did not return their census form. 
Although this may not sound like a lot, consider that in 1990 there were 
approximately 250 million people in the United States. If a household con- 
tains an average of four people, that means that there were 62.5 million 
forms mailed out. Multiplying that figure by 35 percent (the number of 
households that did not return the forms) gives the staggering figure of 
21.875 million forms that were not returned. Of the 21.875 million house- 
holds that did not return forms, census takers were unable to track down 
20 percent, or 4.375 million households. 
Why is this biased sampling? It is believed that of the more than 4 mil- 
lion households not counted, the overwhelming majority was from poorer 
sections of large cities. This implies that certain parts of the country may 
be over-represented in Congress and are the recipients of more federal funds 
than may be deserved. 
Achieving a Large Enough Sample. A second important factor in data 
collection is whether the chosen sample is large enough. Are one thou- 
sand car owners a sufficient number of car owners from which to infer the 
opinion of all car owners? In order to answer this question, the margin of 
error needs to be calculated. 
The margin of error is a statistic that represents a range in which the 
surveyor feels confident that the population as a whole will fall. A sufficient 
sample size needs to have a small margin of error, usually around 5 percent. 
To determine the margin of error (m), divide one by the square root of the 
sample size (s): m = 1 / vs. Therefore, the sample of one thousand car 
owners gives us a margin of error of about 3 percent, an allowable margin 
of error. 
Asking the Proper Questions. Informed citizens who are assessing sur- 
vey results must consider the type of questions that are asked when a sur- 
vey is conducted. Were the questions leading? Were they easy or difficult 
to understand? For example, suppose a study carried out by a local ice cream 
manufacturer states that 75 percent of Americans prefer ice cream. It seems 
self-evident that an ice cream company would not report a study that 
showed Americans do not like ice cream. So perhaps the question in the 
study was leading: for example, "Do you prefer ice cream or spinach?" It 
is therefore important to find out exactly what questions were asked and 
of whom. 
Giving a Proper Interpretation. Data are often interpreted with a bias, 
and the results can therefore be misleading or incomplete. For example, a 
bath soap company claims that its soap is 99 percent pure. This statement 
is misleading because the soap manufacturer does not explain what "pure" 
is. When reading an unclarified percentage such as in the previous exam- 
Data Collection and Interpretation 
pie, one needs to ask such questions. An example of another incomplete or 
misleading interpretation is that the average child watches approximately 5 
hours of television a day. The reader should question what an "average child" 
is. 
Considering Margin of Error. Margin of error is important to consider 
when statistics are reported. For example, we might read that the high school 
dropout rate declined from 18 percent to 16 percent with a margin of er- 
ror of 3 percent. Because the 2-percentage point decline is smaller than the 
margin of error C percent), the new dropout rate may fall between 13 per- 
cent to 19 percent. We cannot be entirely sure that the high school dropout 
rate actually declined at all. 
Confidence intervals, a term usually employed by statisticians, and re- 
lated to margins of error, is reported by a percentage and is constructed to 
relay how confident one can be that the sample is representative of the pop- 
ulation. The producers of this survey may only be 95 percent confident that 
their sample is representative of the population. If this is the case then there 
is a 5 percent chance that this sample data does not typify or carry over to 
the population of the United States. The margin of error represents the 
range of this 95-percent confidence interval (the range that represents plus 
or minus two standard deviations from the mean). 
Understanding and Interpreting Data 
Figuring out what data means is just as important as collecting it. Even if 
the data collection process is sound, data can be misinterpreted. When in- 
terpreting data, the data user must not only attempt to discern the differ- 
ences between causality and coincidence, but also must consider all possible 
factors that may have led to a result. 
After considering the design of a survey, consumers should look at the 
reported data interpretation. Suppose a report states that 52 percent of 
all Americans prefer Chevrolet to other car manufacturers. The survey- 
ors want you to think that more than half of all Americans prefer Chevro- 
let, but is this really the case? Perhaps not all those surveyed were 
Americans. Also, the 52 percent comes from the sample, so it is impor- 
tant to ask if the sample was large enough, unbiased, and randomly cho- 
sen. One also needs to be aware of margins of error and confidence 
intervals. If the margin of error for this survey is 5 percent than this means 
that the percentage of car owners in the United States who prefer Chevro- 
let could actually be between 47 and 57 percent E percent higher or lower 
than the 52 percent). 
Similar questions are important to consider when we try to under- 
stand polls. During the 2000 presidential race, the evening news and news- 
papers were often filled with poll reports. For example, one poll stated 51 
percent of Americans preferred George W. Bush, 46 percent preferred Al 
Gore, and 3 percent were undecided, with a margin of error of plus or 
minus 5 percent. 
The news anchor then went on to report that most Americans prefer 
George W. Bush. However, given the data outlined above, this conclusion 
is questionable. Because the difference between George W. Bush and Al 
Gore is the same as the margin of error, it is impossible to know which

Data Collection and Interpretation 
AN UNNECESSARY SCARE 
A January 1991 report by the 
American Cancer Society pro- 
claimed the odds of a woman 
getting breast cancer had risen 
to one in nine. For obvious rea- 
sons, this scared women all 
over the country. The research 
was sound but was based on a 
lifetime of over 110 years. In 
other words, if a woman lives to 
be 110 years old, there is an 
11 percent chance she will get 
breast cancer. The odds for a 
woman under 50 are closer to 
one in a thousand, or 0.1 per- 
cent. There was nothing wrong 
with the sampling—but the 
interpretation and presentation 
of the data were incomplete. 
candidate was actually preferred. In addition, if we do not know any of the 
circumstances behind the poll, we should be skeptical about its findings. 
As another example, consider census data that shows a radical increase 
in the number of people living in Florida and Arizona along with a decrease 
in the number of people living in New York. One could easily (and falsely) 
conclude that the data "proves" that people are finding New York to be a 
less desirable place to live and therefore are moving away. 
But this hasty conclusion could be missing the big picture. What if the 
data also reveals that the average age of New Yorkers has dropped since 
1990? Further interpretation of the data may reveal that when New York- 
ers grow older, they move to warmer climates to retire. This illustrates why 
data must be thoroughly interpreted before any conclusions can be drawn. 
A Data Checklist. When reading any survey, listening to an advertise- 
ment, or hearing about poll results, informed consumers should ask ques- 
tions about the soundness of the data interpretation. A recap of key points 
follows. 
1. Was the sample unbiased (representative of the whole population)? 
2. Was the sample large enough for the purpose of the survey (margin 
of error of the sample)? 
3. What type of questions did the surveyor ask? Were they simple and 
unambiguous? Were they leading (constructed in such a way to get 
the desired response)? 
4. Can the conclusions drawn be justified based on the information gath- 
ered? 
5. How was the survey done (mail, phone, interview)? Does the survey 
report mention margins of error or confidence intervals, and, if so, 
are these such that the conclusions drawn are warranted? 
By using these checkpoints and learning to think critically about data col- 
lection and interpretation, individuals can become more savvy consumers of 
information, see also Census; Central Tendency, Measures of; Graphs; 
Mass Media, Mathematics and the; Predictions; Randomness; Statis- 
tical Analysis.

Dating Techniques 
Dating Techniques 
Movies and television have presented a romantic vision of archaeology as 
adventure in far-away and exotic locations. A more realistic picture might 
show researchers digging in smelly mud for hours under the hot sun while 
battling relentless mosquitoes. This type of archaeological research produces 
hundreds of small plastic bags containing pottery shards, animal bones, bits 
of worked stone, and other fragments. These findings must be classified, 
which requires more hours of tedious work in a stuffy tent. At its best, ar- 
chaeology involves a studious examination of the past with the goal of learn- 
ing important information about the culture and customs of ancient (or not 
so ancient) peoples. Much archaeology in the early twenty-first century in- 
vestigates the recent past, a sub-branch called "historical archaeology." 
What Is Archaeology? 
Archaeology is the study of the material remains of past human cultures. It 
is distinguished from other forms of inquiry by its method of study, exca- 
vation. (Most archaeologists call this "digging.") Excavation is not simply 
digging until something interesting is found. That sort of unscientific dig- 
ging destroys the archaeological information. Archaeological excavation re- 
quires the removal of material layer by layer to expose artifacts in place. The 
removed material is carefully sifted to find small artifacts, tiny animal bones, 
and other remains. Archaeologists even examine the soil in various layers 
for microscopic material, such as pollen. Excavations, in combination with 
surveys, may yield maps of a ruin or collections of artifacts. 
Time is important to archaeologists. There is rarely enough time to 
complete the work, but of even greater interest is the time that has passed 
since the artifact was created. An important part of archaeology is the ex- 
amination of how cultures change over rime. It is therefore essential that 
the archaeologist is able to establish the age of the artifacts or other mate- 
rial remains and arrange them in a chronological sequence. The archaeol- 
ogist must be able to distinguish between objects that were made at the same 
time and objects that were made at different times. When objects that were 
made at different times are excavated, the archaeologist must be able to 
arrange them in a sequence from the oldest to the most recent. 
Relative Dating and Absolute Dating 
Before scientific dating techniques such as dendrochronology and radiocar- 
bon dating were introduced to archaeology, the discipline was dominated 
by extensive discussions of the chronological sequence of events. Most of 
those questions have now been settled and archaeologists have moved on to 
other issues. Scientific dating techniques have had a huge impact on ar- 
chaeology. 
Archaeologists use many different techniques to determine the age of 
an object. Usually, several different techniques are applied to the same ob- 
ject. Relative dating arranges artifacts in a chronological sequence from 
oldest to most recent without reference to the actual date. For example, by 
studying the decorations used on pottery, the types of materials used in the 
pottery, and the types and shapes of pots, it is often possible to arrange them

superposition the plac- 
ing of one thing on top 
of another 
correlate to establish a 
mutual or reciprocal 
relation between two 
things or sets of things 
into a sequence without knowing the actual date. In absolute dating, the 
age of an object is determined by some chemical or physical process with- 
out reference to a chronology. 
Relative Dating Methods. The most common and widely used relative 
dating technique is stratigraphy. The principle of superposition (borrowed 
from geology) states that higher layers must be deposited on top of lower 
layers. Thus, higher layers are more recent than lower layers. This only ap- 
plies to undisturbed deposits. Rodent burrows, root action, and human ac- 
tivity can mix layers in a process known as bioturbation. However, the 
archaeologist can detect bioturbation and allow for its effects. 
Discrete layers of occupation can often be determined. For example, 
Hisarlik, which is a hill in Turkey, is thought by some archaeologists to be 
the site of the ancient city of Troy. However, Hisarlik was occupied by many 
different cultures at various times both before and after the time of Troy, 
and each culture built on top of the ruins of the previous culture, often af- 
ter violent conquest. Consequently, the layers in this famous archaeologi- 
cal site represent many different cultures. An early excavator of Hisarlik, 
Heinrich Schleimann, inadvertently dug through the Troy layer into an ear- 
lier occupation and mistakenly assigned the gold artifacts he found there to 
Troy. Other sites have been continuously occupied by the same culture for 
a long time and the different layers represent gradual changes. In both cases, 
stratigraphy will apply. 
A chronology based on stratigraphy often can be correlated to layers 
in other nearby sites. For example, a particular type or pattern of pottery 
may occur in only one layer in an excavation. If the same pottery type is 
found in another excavation nearby, it is safe to assume that the layers are 
the same age. Archaeologists rarely make these determinations on the basis 
of a single example. Usually, a set of related artifacts is used to determine 
the age of a layer. 
Seriation simply means ordering. This technique was developed by the 
inventor of modern archaeology, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. Se- 
riation is based on the assumption that cultural characteristics change over 
time. For example, consider how automobiles have changed in the last 50 
years (a relatively short time in archaeology). Automobile manufacturers fre- 
quently introduce new styles about every year, so archaeologists thousands 
of years from now will have no difficulty identifying the precise date of a 
layer if the layer contains automobile parts. 
Cultural characteristics tend to show a particular pattern over time. The 
characteristic is introduced into the culture (for example, using a certain 
type of projectile point for hunting or wearing low-riding jeans), becomes 
progressively more popular, then gradually wanes in popularity. The method 
of seriation uses this distinctive pattern to arrange archaeological materials 
into a sequence. However, seriation only works when variations in a cul- 
tural characteristic are due to rapid and significant change over time. It also 
works best when a characteristic is widely shared among many different 
members of a group. Even then, it can only be applied to a small geographic 
area, because there is also geographic variation in cultural characteristics. 
For example, 50 years ago American automobiles changed every year while 
the Volkswagen Beetle hardly changed at all from year to year. 
Dating Techniques 
Cross dating is also based on stratigraphy. It uses the principle that dif- 
ferent archaeological sites will show a similar collection of artifacts in lay- 
ers of the same age. Sir Flinders Petrie used this method to establish the 
time sequence of artifacts in Egyptian cemeteries by identifying which buri- 
als contained Greek pottery vessels. These same Greek pottery styles could 
be associated with monuments in Greece whose construction dates were 
fairly well known. Since absolute dating techniques have become common, 
the use of cross dating has decreased significantly. 
Pollen grains also appear in archaeological layers. They are abundant 
and they survive very well in archaeological contexts. As climates change 
over time, the plants that grow in a region change as well. People who ex- 
amine pollen grains (the study of which is known as pollen analysis) can 
usually determine the genus, and often the exact species producing a cer- 
tain pollen type. Archaeologists can then use this information to determine 
the relative ages of some sites and layers within sites. However, climates do 
not change rapidly, so this type of analysis is best for archaeological sites 
dating back to the last ice age. 
Absolute Dating Methods. Absolute dating methods produce an actual 
date, usually accurate to within a few years. This date is established inde- 
pendent of stratigraphy and chronology. If a date for a certain layer in an 
excavation can be established using an absolute dating method, other arti- 
facts in the same layer can safely be assigned the same age. 
Dendrochronology, also known as tree-ring dating, is the earliest form 
of absolute dating. This method was first developed by the American as- 
tronomer Andrew Ellicott Douglas at the University of Arizona in the early 
1900s. Douglas was trying to develop a correlation between climate varia- 
tions and sunspot activity, but archaeologists quickly recognized its use- 
fulness as a dating tool. The technique was first applied in the American 
Southwest and later extended to other parts of the world. 
Tree-ring dating is relatively simple. Trees add a new layer of cambium 
(the layer right under the bark) every year. The thickness of the layer de- 
pends on local weather and climate. In years with plenty of rain, the layer 
will be thick and healthy. Over the lifetime of the tree, these rings accu- 
mulate, and the rings form a record of regional variation in climate that may 
extend back hundreds of years. Since all of the trees in a region experience 
the same climate variations, they will have similar growth patterns and sim- 
ilar tree ring patterns. 
One tree usually does not cover a period sufficiently long to be archae- 
ologically useful. However, patterns of tree ring growth have been built up 
by "overlapping" ring sequences from different trees so that the tree ring 
record extends back several thousand years in many parts of the world. The 
process starts with examination of the growth ring patterns of samples from 
living trees. Then older trees are added to the sequence by overlapping the 
inner rings of a younger sample with the outer rings of an older sample. 
Older trees are recovered from old buildings, archaeological sites, peat bogs, 
and swamps. Eventually, a regional master chronology is constructed. 
When dendrochronology can be used, it provides the most accurate 
dates of any technique. In the American Southwest, the accuracy and pre- 
cision of dendrochronology has enabled the development of one of the most

unmatched in most of the world. 
Radiometric dating methods are more recent than dendrochronology. 
However, dendrochronology provides an important calibration technique 
for radiocarbon dating techniques. All radiometric-dating techniques are 
based on the well-established principle from physics that large samples of 
radioactive isotopes decay at precisely known rates. The rate of decay of a 
radioactive isotope is usually given by its half-life. The decay of any indi- 
vidual nucleus is completely random. The half-life is a measure of the prob- 
ability that a given atom will decay in a certain time. The shorter the half-life, 
the more likely the atom will decay. This probability does not increase with 
time. If an atom has not decayed, the probability that it will decay in the 
future remains exactly the same. This means that no matter how many atoms 
are in a sample, approximately one-half will decay in one half-life. The re- 
maining atoms have exactly the same decay probability, so in another half- 
life, one half of the remaining atoms will decay. The amount of time required 
for one-half of a radioactive sample to decay can be precisely determined. 
The particular radioisotope used to determine the age of an object depends 
on the type of object and its age. 
Radiocarbon is the most common and best known of radiometric dat- 
ing techniques, but it is also possibly the most misunderstood. It was de- 
veloped at the University of Chicago in 1949 by a group of American 
scientists led by Willard F. Libby. Radiocarbon dating has had an enormous 
impact on archaeology. In the last 50 years, radiocarbon dating has provided 
the basis for a worldwide cultural chronology. Recognizing the importance 
of this technique, the Nobel Prize committee awarded the Prize in Chem- 
istry to Libby in 1960. 
Dating Techniques 
The physics behind radiocarbon dating is straightforward. Earth's 
atmosphere is constantly bombarded with cosmic rays from outer space. Cos- 
mic-ray neutrons collide with atoms of nitrogen in the upper atmosphere, 
converting them to atoms of radioactive carbon-14. The carbon-14 atom 
quickly combines with an oxygen molecule to form carbon dioxide. This ra- 
dioactive carbon dioxide spreads throughout Earth's atmosphere, where it is 
taken up by plants along with normal carbon-12. As long as the plant is alive, 
the relative amount (ratio) of carbon-14 to carbon-12 remains constant at 
about one carbon-14 atom for every one trillion carbon-12 atoms. Some an- 
imals eat plants and other animals eat the plant-eaters. As long as they are 
alive, all living organisms have the same ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 as 
in the atmosphere because the radioactive carbon is continually replenished, 
either through photosynthesis or through the food animals eat. 
However, when the plant or animal dies, the intake of carbon-14 stops 
and the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 immediately starts to decrease. The 
half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years. After 5,730 years, about one-half of the 
carbon-14 atoms will have decayed. After another 5,730 years, one-half of 
the remaining atoms will have decayed. So after 11,460 years, only one- 
fourth will remain. After 17,190 years, one-eighth of the original carbon- 
14 will remain. After 22,920 years, one-sixteenth will remain. 
Radiocarbon dating has become the standard technique for determin- 
ing the age of organic remains (those remains that contain carbon). There 
are many factors that must be taken into account when determining the age 
of an object. The best objects are bits of charcoal that have been preserved 
in completely dry environments. The worst candidates are bits of wood that 
have been saturated with sea water, since sea water contains dissolved at- 
mospheric carbon dioxide that may throw off the results. Radiocarbon dat- 
ing can be used for small bits of clothing or other fabric, bits of bone, baskets, 
or anything that contains organic material. 
There are well over 100 labs worldwide that do radiocarbon dating. In the 
early twenty-first century, the dating of objects up to about 10 half-lives, or 
up to about 50,000 years old, is possible. However, objects less than 300 years 
old cannot be reliably dated because of the widespread burning of fossil fuels, 
which began in the nineteenth century, and the production of carbon-14 from 
atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 1960s. Another prob- 
lem with radiocarbon dating is that the production of carbon-14 in the at- 
mosphere has not been constant, due to variation in solar activity. For example, 
in the 1700s, solar activity dropped (a phenomenon called the "Maunder Min- 
imum"), so carbon-14 production also decreased during this period. To achieve 
the highest level of accuracy, carbon-14 dates must be calibrated by compari- 
son to dates obtained from dendrochronology. 
Calibration of Radiocarbon Dates. Samples of Bristlecone pine, a tree 
with a very long life span, have been dated using both dendrochronology 
and radiocarbon dating. The results do not agree, but the differences are 
consistent. That is, the radiocarbon dates were always wrong by the same 
number of years. Consequently, tree-ring chronologies have been used to 
calibrate radiocarbon dates to around 12,000 years ago. 
When radiocarbon dating was first put into use, it was decided that dates 
would always be reported as B.P., where B.P. stood for "before present" and

termines that an object has a radiocarbon age of 1,050 years in 2000, its age 
will be given as 1000 B.P. Calibrated dates are given using the actual date, 
such as 950 C.E. 
Potassium-Argon Dating. If an object is too old to be dated by radiocar- 
bon dating, or if it contains no organic material, other methods must be 
used. One of these is potassium-argon dating. All naturally occurring rocks 
contain potassium. Some of the potassium in rocks is the radioactive iso- 
tope potassium-40. Potassium-40 gradually decays to the stable isotope 
argon-40, which is a gas. When the rock is melted, as in a volcano, any ar- 
gon gas trapped in the rock escapes. When the rock cools, the argon will 
begin to build up. So this method can be used to measure the age of any 
volcanic rock, from 100,000 years up to around 5 billion years old. 
This method is not widely used in archaeology, since most archaeolog- 
ical deposits are not associated with volcanic activity. However, Louis and 
Mary Leakey successfully used the method to determine the ages of fossils 
in Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by examining rocks from lava flows above 
and below the fossils. They were able to establish an absolute chronology 
for humans and human ancestors extending back two million years. At Lae- 
tolli, in Tanzania, volcanic ash containing early hominid footprints was 
dated by this method at 3.5 million years. 
Other Methods. Uranium-238 is present in most rocks. This isotope of 
uranium spontaneously undergoes fission. The fission fragments have a lot 
of energy, and they plow through the rock, leaving a track that can be made 
visible by treating the rock. So by counting fission tracks, the age of the 
rock can be determined. Like potassium-argon dating, this can only be used 
to determine the age of the rock, not the age of the artifact itself. 
Thermoluminescence is a recently developed technique that uses the 
property of some crystals to "store" light. Sometimes an electron will be 
knocked out of its position in a crystal and will "stick" somewhere else in 
the crystal. These displaced electrons will accumulate over time. If the sam- 
ple is heated, the electrons will fall back to their normal positions, emitting 
a small flash of light. By measuring the light emitted, the time that has passed 
since the artifact was heated can be determined. This method should prove 
to be especially useful in determining the age of ceramics, rocks that have 
been used to build fire rings, and samples of chert and flint that have been 
deliberately heated to make them easier to flake into a projectile point. 
Conclusion 
Science continues to develop new methods to determine the age of objects. 
As our knowledge of past chronologies improves, archaeologists will be bet- 
ter able to understand how cultures change over time, and how different 
cultures interact with each other. As a result, this knowledge will enable us 
to achieve a progressively better understanding of our own culture, see also

Decimals 
The number system most commonly used today is based on the Hindu- 
Arabic number system, which was developed in what is now India around 
300 B.C.E. The Arab mathematicians adopted this system and brought it to 
Spain, where it slowly spread to the rest of Europe. 
The present-day number system, which is called the decimal^ or base- 
10 number system, is an elegant and efficient way to express numbers. The 
rules for performing arithmetic calculations are simple and straightforward. 
Basic Properties 
The decimal number system is based on two fundamental properties. First, 
numbers are constructed from ten digits, or numerals—0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, and 9—that are arranged in a sequence. Second, the position of a digit 
in the sequence determines its value, called the place value. Because each 
digit, by its place value, represents a multiple of a power of 10, the system 
is called base-10. 
Numbers Greater and Less Than One. The expansion of numbers greater 
than 1 consists of sums of groups of tens. Each digit in the expansion rep- 
resents how many groups of tens are present. The groups are Is, 10s, 100s, 
and so on. The groups are arranged in order, with the right-most repre- 
senting 10°, or groups of Is. The next digit to the left in the group stands 
for 101, or groups of 10s, and so on. For example, the expansion of the whole 
number 3,254 in the decimal system is expressed as: 
3,254 = C x 103) + B x 102) + E x 101) + D x 10°) 
= 3000 + 200 + 50 + 4. 
A number less than 1 is represented by a sequence of numbers to the 
right of a decimal point. The digits to the right of a decimal point are mul- 
tiplied by 10 raised to a negative power, starting from negative 1. In mov- 
ing to the right, the place value decreases in value, each being one-tenth as 
small as the previous place value. Thus, each successive digit to the right of 
the decimal point denotes the number of tenths, hundredths, thousandths, 
and so forth. For example, the expansion of 0.3574 is expressed as: 
0.3574 = C X 10) + E X 10) + G X 10) + D X 10) 
= 0.3 + 0.05 + 0.007 + 0.0004. 
Decimal Fractions. The example above illustrates standard decimal no- 
tation for a number less than 1. But what is commonly referred to as a dec- 
imal is actually a decimal fraction. A decimal fraction is a number written 
in decimal notation that does not have any digits except 0 to the left of the 
decimal point. For example, .257 is a decimal fraction, which can also be

DECIMALS AND 
FRACTIONS 
Every fraction can be repre- 
sented by a decimal that either 
terminates or eventually 
repeats. Also, every decimal 
that either terminates or eventu- 
ally repeats can be represented 
as a fraction. 
written as 0.257. It is preferable to use 0 to the left of the decimal point 
when there are no other digits to the left of the decimal point. 
Decimal fractions can be converted into a fraction using a power of 10. 
For example, 0.486 = y^, and 0.35 = y^. The fraction may be converted 
to an equivalent fraction by writing it in its simplest or reduced form. The 
fraction ^ equals ^, for example. 
Decimal Expansion of Rational and Irrational Numbers 
Is it possible to convert all fractions into decimals and all decimals into frac- 
tions? All fractions, j, are rational numbers, and all rational numbers are 
fractions, provided b is not 0. So the question is: Can every rational num- 
ber be converted into a decimal? 
Taking the rational number, or fraction j, and dividing the numerator 
by the denominator will always produce a decimal. For example, ^ = 0.25, 
Yq = 0.1, and j = 0.4. In each of these examples, the numbers to the right 
of the decimal point end, or terminate. 
However, the conversion of ^ = 0.333. . ., -^ = 0.222. . ., and yj = 
0.2727. . ., results in decimals that are nonterminating. In the first example, 
the calculation continuously produces 3, which repeats indefinitely. In the 
second example, 2 repeats indefinitely. In the third example, the pair of dig- 
its 2 and 7 repeats indefinitely. 
When a digit or group of digits repeats indefinitely, a bar is placed above 
the digit or digits. Thus, ^ = 0.3, ^ = 0.2, and yj = 0.27. These are exam- 
ples of repeating but nonterminating decimals. 
It may not always be apparent when decimals start repeating. One in- 
teresting example is yy. The division needs to be carried out to sixteen dig- 
its before the repeating digits appear: 
^ = 0.1764705882352941. 
Nonterminating and nonrepeating decimal numbers exist, and some may 
have predictable patterns, such as 0.313113111311113. . .. However, these 
numbers are not considered rational, but instead are known as irrational. An 
irrational number cannot be represented as a decimal with terminating or 
repeating digits, but instead yields a nonterminating, nonrepeating sequence. 
A familiar example of an irrational number is V 2, which in decimal 
form is expressed as 1.414213. . ., where the digits after the decimal point 
neither end nor repeat. Another example of an irrational number is ??, which 
in decimal form is expressed as 3.141592. . . . 
Daily Applications of Decimals 
In daily use, decimal numbers are used for counting and measuring. Con-

of running shoes, a warm-up jacket, and a pair of socks. The total cost is 
calculated by aligning at the right all three numbers on top of each other.

Descartes and His Coordinate System 
As another example, consider a car's gas tank that has a capacity of 18.5 
gallons. If the gas tank is full after pumping 7.2 gallons, how much gasoline 
was already in the tank? The answer is 18.5 minus 7.2, which equals 11.3 
gallons. SEE ALSO FRACTIONS; NUMBERS, IRRATIONAL; NUMBERS, RATIONAL;

Descartes and His Coordinate System 
Every time you graph an equation on a Cartesian coordinate system, you 
are using the work of Rene Descartes. Descartes, a French mathematician 
and philosopher, was born in La Have, France (now named in his honor) 
on March 31, 1596. His parents taught him at home until he was 8 years 
old, when he entered the Jesuit college of La Fleche. There he continued 
his studies until he graduated at age 18. 
Descartes was an outstanding student at La Fleche, especially in math- 
ematics. Because of his delicate health, his teachers allowed him to stay in 
bed until late morning. Despite missing most of his morning classes, 
Descartes was able to keep up with his studies. He would continue the habit 
of staying late in bed for his entire adult life. 
After graduating from La Fleche, Descartes traveled to Paris and even- 
tually enrolled at the University of Poitiers. He graduated with a law de- 
gree in 1616 and then enlisted in a military school. In 1619, he joined the 
Bavarian army and spent the next nine years as a soldier, touring through- 
out much of Europe in between military campaigns. Descartes eventually 
settled in Holland, where he spent most of the rest of his life. There 
Descartes gave up a military career and decided on a life of mathematics 
and philosophy. 
Descartes attempted to provide a philosophical foundation for the new 
mechanistic physics that was developing from the work of Copernicus and 
Galileo. He divided all things into two categories—mind and matter—and 
developed a dualistic philosophical system in which, although mind is sub- 
ject to the will and does not follow physical laws, all matter must obey the 
same mechanistic laws. 
The philosophical system that Descartes developed, known as Carte- 
sian philosophy, was based on skepticism and asserted that all reliable 
Rene Descartes built the 
foundation for modern 
philosophical method with 
a simple catchphrase: 
"I think, therefore I am." 
He is also regarded as 
the founder of analytic 
geometry.

GEOMETRY AND THE FLY 
Some mathematics historians 
claim it may be that 
Descartes's inspiration for the 
coordinate system was due to 
his lifelong habit of staying late 
in bed. According to some 
accounts, one morning 
Descartes noticed a fly walking 
across the ceiling of his bed- 
room. As he watched the fly, 
Descartes began to think of 
how the fly's path could be 
described without actually trac- 
ing its path. His further reflec- 
tions about describing a path by 
means of mathematics led to 
La Geomethe and Descartes's 
invention of coordinate 
geometry.

knowledge must be built up by the use of reason through logical analysis. 
Cartesian philosophy was influential in the ultimate success of the Scien- 
tific Revolution and provides the foundation upon which most subsequent 
philosophical thought is grounded. 
Descartes published various treatises about philosophy and mathemat- 
ics. In 1637 Descartes published his masterwork, Discourse on the Method of 
Reasoning Well and Seeking Truth in the Sciences. In Discourse, Descartes sought 
to explain everything in terms of matter and motion. Discourse contained 
three appendices, one on optics, one on meteorology, and one titled La 
Geometrie (The Geometry). In La Geometrie, Descartes described what is 
now known as the system of Cartesian Coordinates, or coordinate geome- 
try. In Descartes's system of coordinates, geometry and algebra were united 
for the first time to create what is known as analytic geometry. 
The Cartesian Coordinate System 
Cartesian coordinates are used to locate a point in space by giving its rela- 
tive distance from perpendicular intersecting lines. In coordinate geome- 
try, all points, lines, and figures are drawn in a coordinate plane. By 
reference to the two coordinate axes, any point, line, or figure may be pre- 
cisely located. 
In Descartes's system, the first coordinate value (r-coordinate) describes 
where along the horizontal axis (the x-axis) the point is located. The second 
coordinate value (j/-coordinate) locates the point in terms of the vertical axis 
(the j'-axis). A point with coordinates D, —2) is located four units to the 
right of the intersection point of the two axes (point O, or the origin) and 
then two units below the vertical position of the origin. In example (a) of 
the figure, point D is at the coordinate location D, —2). The coordinates 
for point A are C, 2); for point B, B, —4); and for point C, (—2, —5). 
The coordinate system also makes it possible to exactly duplicate geo- 
metric figures. For example, the triangle shown in (b) has coordinates A C, 
2), ? D, 5), and ? (—2, 4) that make it possible to duplicate the triangle 
without reference to any drawing. 
The triangle may be reproduced by using the coordinates to locate the 
position of the three vertex points. The vertex points may then be con- 
nected with segments to replicate triangle ABC. More complex figures may 
likewise be described and duplicated with coordinates. 
A straight line may also be represented on a coordinate grid. In the case 
of a straight line, every point on the line has coordinate values that must

satisfy a specific equation. The line in (c) may be expressed as ? = 2?. The 
coordinates of every point on the line will satisfy the equation ? = 2x, as 
for example, point A A, 2) and point ? B, 4). More complex equations are 
used to represent circles, ellipses, and curved lines. 
Other Contributions 
La Geometrie made Descartes famous throughout Europe. He continued to 
publish his philosophy, detailing how to acquire accurate knowledge. His 
philosophy is sometimes summed up in his statement, "I think, therefore I 
am." 
Descartes also made a number of other contributions to mathematics. 
He discovered the Law of Angular Deficiency for all polyhedrons and was 
the first to offer a quantifiable explanation of rainbows. In La Geometrie, 
Descartes introduced a familiar mathematics symbol, a raised number to in- 
dicate an exponent. The expression 4X4X4X4X4 may be written as 
45 using Descartes's notation. He also instituted using x, y, and z for un- 
knowns in an equation. 
In 1649, Descartes accepted an invitation from Queen Christina to travel 
to Sweden to be the royal tutor. Unfortunately for Descartes, the queen ex- 
pected to be tutored while she did her exercises at 5:00 A.M. in an unheated 
library. Descartes had been used to a lifetime of sleeping late, and the new 
routine was much too rigorous for him. After only a few weeks of this reg- 
imen, Descartes contracted pneumonia and died on February 11, 1650. see

WHO USES 
COORDINATES? 
The system of coordinates that 
Descartes invented is used in 
many modern applications. For 
example, on any map the loca- 
tion of a country or a city is 
usually given as a set of coordi- 
nates. The location of a ship at 
sea is determined by longitude 
and latitude, which is an appli- 
cation of the coordinate system 
to the curved surface of Earth.

Dimensional Relationships 
Usually, when mathematicians compare the size of two-dimensional objects, 
they compare their areas. For example, how many times larger is a larger 
square than a smaller one? One way to answer this question is to determine 
the lengths of the sides of the squares, and use this information to find the 
respective areas. 
Dimensions 
ratio of similitude the 
ratio of the correspond- 
ing sides of similar fig- 
ures 
Use the formula for the area of a square, A = S2, where A represents 
area and 5 represents the side length of the square. Suppose two squares 
have side lengths of 2 and 6, respectively. Hence, the respective areas are 4 
and 36. Thus the area of the larger square is nine times that of the smaller 
square. Therefore, a square whose side length is three times that of a sec- 
ond square will have an area nine times as great. 
Use the notation Sx to denote the side of the smaller square and S2 to 
denote the side of the larger square. With this notation, S2 = 3SX. The area 
of the larger square then becomes (?^J = ?^ ? ?^ = 98?2. This can be 
generalized further by letting one side of the square be k times the side of 
another, also known as the ratio of similitude (k) between the figures. Then 
(kSiJ = kSi X kSx = k2Sx2. From this, it is evident that if the side lengths 
of one square are k times the side lengths of another, the area of the first is 
k2 that of the other. 
This principle is true for any two-dimensional object. Suppose two cir- 
cles have radii that are in the ratio of 2:1. Letting R2 = 2RU the area of the 
larger circle can be represented ?? ? = ??B7?1J = ^ttR2. 
As another example, suppose the sides and altitude of the larger trian- 
gle are twice those of a smaller triangle. Thus the area of the larger trian- 
gle can be written as A = \{2bx){2hx) = 2bxhx = ity^). 
For three-dimensional objects, volumes of similar figures relate to each 
other in a manner akin to areas of two-dimensional figures. A cube, for ex- 
ample, with a side length twice that of another cube, will have a volume 23 
= 8 times as great. A sphere with a radius five times that of a smaller sphere 
will have a volume 53 = 125 times as great. 
If k represents the ratio of similitude of two similar objects, then the 
areas of the two objects will be in the ratio of k2, and the volumes of the 
two objects will be in the ratio of k3. see also Dimensions. 
Albert Goetz 
Dimensions 
A dimension is a measurement of space. In a three-dimensional world, we 
usually think of three different directions as we measure the space in which 
we exist—length, width, and height. To indicate a certain location in space, 
we would provide three different coordinates on three different axes (x, y, 
and z). 
The understanding of different dimensions is crucial in understanding 
much of mathematics. The ability to visualize and a flexibility in adjusting 
to 72-dimensional worlds is a skill worth pursuing. 
Portraying Three Dimensions 
Fven though most everyday experience is in three dimensions, most high 
school mathematics takes place in a two-dimensional world in which there 
is only length and width. Part of this is because traditional learning is largely 
communicated through books or on a chalkboard. Book pages or the planes 
of chalkboards have primarily two dimensions. Even if there is a picture in 
Dimensions 
a book of a three-dimensional object, the object is "flattened" so that its 
likeness can be communicated through a two-dimensional medium. This 
can cause differences between what we see in a three-dimensional object 
and how the object is portrayed in two dimensions. 
For example, consider a cube. In real life, a vertex of a cube is formed 
when three 90° angles from three different square faces intersect at a point. 
However, in a two-dimensional representation of a cube, the right angles 
may measure other than 90° on the page. For example, in the picture of the 
cube below, each angle around the center vertex measures close to 120°. 
The image of the three-dimensional object must be altered this way in or- 
der for it to give us the perception that it is really three-dimensional. 
vertex the point on a 
triangle or polygon 
where two sides come 
together 
Portraying three dimensions in two-dimensional representations can 
also play tricks with our sense of perception. Many optical illusions are cre- 
ated by taking an impossible figure in three dimensions and drawing a two- 
dimensional picture of it. 
Artist M. C. Escher was a master of communicating impossible ideas 
through two-dimensional drawings. In many of his engravings, the scene is 
impossible to construct in three dimensions, but by working with angles and 
making a few simple alterations, Escher fools our normally reliable sense of 
perception. 
Imagining Dimensions 
Points, lines, and planes are theoretical concepts typically modeled with 
three-dimensional objects in which we learn to ignore some of their di- 
mensions. For example, earlier it was stated that a piece of paper or a plane 
is primarily two-dimensional. Although a piece of paper clearly has a thick- 
ness (height), albeit small, we think of it as being two-dimensional. So when 
considering objects with different dimensions, we must be able to visualize 
and think abstractly. 
When we think of a plane, we start with a sheet of paper, which has 
length, width, and a very small height. Then we imagine that the height 
slowly disappears until all that remains is a length and a width. Similarly, 
when we draw lines on a chalkboard, we know that the chalkdust has length, 
a small width, and even an infinitesimal thickness. However, a mathe- 
matician imagines the line as having only one dimension: length. Finally 
when we consider a point in space, we must imagine that the point is 
merely a position or a location in space: that is, it has no size. To imag- 
ine a point, begin with an image of a fixed atom in space that is slowly

melting or disappearing until all that remains is its location. That location 
is a true mathematical image of a point. 
A college professor gave the following way to think about dimensions. 
Start with a figure of zero dimensions: that is, a point. Set two of these items 
next to each other and connect them with a line segment. You now have a 
new entity of one dimension called a line segment. Again set two of these 
line segments next to each other and connect them with line segments. You 
now have a two-dimensional entity called a square. Connect two squares, 
and you have a three-dimensional entity called a cube. Connect the vertices 
of two cubes and you have a four-dimensional entity sometimes known as 
a hypercube or tesseract.^ 
0 dimensions 1 dimension 
2 dimensions

If you are having trouble visualizing a tesseract (as shown above), keep 
in mind that you are looking at a two-dimensional picture of something that 
is four-dimensional! Even if you build a three-dimensional physical model 
of a tesseract, you will still need to imagine the missing dimension that would 
bring us from three dimensions into four. 
Abbott's Flatland 
Imagining worlds of different dimensions is the premise of Edwin A. Ab- 
bott's book, Flatland. He describes an entire civilization that lives in a world 
with only two dimensions. All of its inhabitants are either lines, or polygons 
such as triangles, squares, and pentagons. These individuals cannot perceive 
of anything but length and width. Imagine, for example, living in a black- 
board and only being able to move from side to side or up and down. Depth 
would be an unknown quantity. 
Abbott's book describes a day when a sphere visits a family in Flatland. 
Because Flatlanders are unable to perceive a third dimension of depth, they 
are only able to perceive first a point (as the sphere first entered their world), 
then a small circle which increases in area until it reaches the very middle 
of the sphere, and then a circle of decreasing area until it becomes a point 
again. Then it disappears. Imagine trying to communicate to these Flat- 
landers anything about the third dimension when they had never experi- 
enced anything in that realm. 
Use a similar analogy when thinking about what four dimensions might 
be like. Even if a creature from the fourth dimension visited us here in three- 
dimensional "Spaceland," and tried to describe the fourth dimension to us, 
we would not be equipped to understand it fully, see also Coordinates, 
Three-Dimensional; Escher, M. C; Mathematics, Impossible.

Distance, Measurement of 
In the twenty-first century, societies need to make a wide range of mea- 
surements, from economic indicators and population trends to the times of 
sporting events and various standardized tests. Despite all of the varied mea- 
surement that is performed, modern societies still focus attention on the 
same two subjects, time and distance. In this entry, the focus will be on the 
measurement of distance. 
Early Attempts to Measure Distance 
Early civilizations used various crude instruments to measure distance, rang- 
ing from a simple pace to measuring rods and marked cords. The accuracy 
that was achieved with such basic devices can be astonishing. For example, 
the Great Pyramid of Egypt, built about 2400 B.C.E., has four base edges 
that are each within 0.01 percent of 751 feet in length. 
Most societies developed random units of measure that became stan- 
dardized over time. The Egyptians used the cubit, which varied in length 
from 15 inches to 19 inches, depending on the ruling dynasty. To measure 
longer distances, some societies employed individuals to pace off the dis- 
tance. In Egypt, these individuals were called "rope stretchers." They tied 
a specific length of rope to their two ankles and then paced off the distance 
so that each and every stride stretched the rope to its full length. The Egyp- 
tians used other crude measuring devices, such as marked cords and wooden 
rods. Each of the four faces of the Great Pyramid is positioned exactly on 
one of the four points of the compass. A groma was used to establish right 
angles for such measuring purposes. The groma was a wooden cross that 
pivoted and had plumb lines hanging from each arm to ensure proper po- 
sitioning. 
Distance measurement remained static for centuries after the Egyptians, 
with few advancements. About 500 B.C.E., Greek mathematician Thales 
demonstrated how to use the geometric principles of similarity to measure 
distances indirectly. For example, Thales used shadows to measure the 
height of the Great Pyramid. Still, the data needed for such indirect mea- 
surements had to be found using cords and measuring rods. 
Two hundred years later, Greek mathematician Eratosthenes determined 
the circumference of Earth to within a few hundred miles by using geomet- 
ric principles and data from rope stretchers. About 200 B.C.E., the astrolabe 
was invented to measure the angle of elevation of various stars. These data 
were used to find the time of day, which in turn was used by sailors for nav- 
igation. Later developments led to its replacement by the sextant. In the 
1600s, the theodolite was invented, which is a device that measures angles of

a telescope that pivots around horizontal and vertical axes. Modern theodo- 
lites can measure angles to an accuracy of 1/3600 of a degree. 
In 1620, Edmund Gunther A581-1626) invented a chain to survey land. 
It was 66 feet long and not subject to humidity, fraying, or other irregular- 
ities that might affect a rope or cord. The chain was the precursor to the 
modern steel tape measure. At about the same time, the telescope was in- 
vented. This made it possible to see great distances across the heavens and 
to see stars that had previously been beyond human sight. The distances be- 
tween celestial bodies remained unknown, but advances in telescopes gave 
rise to the ability to measure distances across the heavens. During the same 
time period, Anthony Leeuwenhoek invented the first modern microscope, 
opening up a new world of discovery at the opposite end of the measure- 
ment spectrum. 
Modern Advances in Distance Measurement 
The early twentieth century saw great advancements in distance measure- 
ments. First, aerial photography made accurate measurements of distances 
across difficult terrain easily possible. This was followed by satellite pho- 
tography, making it feasible to survey great tracts of land easily. In the 
twenty-first century, modern theodolites employ electromagnetic distance 
measurement processes. These instruments measure the time a laser or ul- 
tra high radiation (either microwave for longer distances or infrared radia- 
tion for shorter distances) needs to pass over a specific distance. Modern 
surveying instruments send out a laser pulse to a target on location. The 
target reflects the laser beam back to the surveyor. The time required to 
travel out and back is measured by a computer, which then calculates the 
distance. At the other end of measurable distances, powerful electronic mi- 
croscopes enable scientists to see increasingly smaller objects. 
Modern precision instruments have even affected standard measurement 
units like the meter. Originally the standard meter was a length of platinum 
that was exactly one meter long. However, a metallic object can grow or 
shrink according to atmospheric conditions. The effects of dust and han- 
dling can also affect such an object, although only at a microscopic level. 
To avoid such effects, a meter is now defined as the distance that light in a 
vacuum travels in 1/229,792,458 of a second. 
Modern precision has made it possible to measure extremely large and 
small distances. The longest distance measurement is for galaxies that are 14 
billion light years from Earth. (Light travels approximately 186,000 miles per 
second. A light year is how far light travels in a year.) This distance is re- 
ferred to as 1025 meters. At the other end of the scale, scientists use scan- 
ning electron microscopes to see molecular particles that are 10 16 meters 
long, or 0.1 Fermi in length. (One Fermi is 10 15 meter.) How much more 
precision is still possible to achieve is difficult to predict. Most scientists agree 
that there are objects in the universe that are even farther away from Earth. 
Newer, more powerful telescopes will likely be able to detect them and mea- 
sure their distance from Earth. Scientists also envision a time when objects 
as small as an individual atom or even subatomic particles will be "visible" 
and thus can be measured, see also Astronomy, Measurements in;

The number 0 has unique properties, including when a number is multi- 
plied or divided by 0. Multiplying a number by 0 equals 0. For example, 
256 X 0 = 0. Dividing a number by 0, however, is undefined. 
Why is dividing a number by 0 undefined? Suppose dividing 5 by 0 pro- 
duces a number x: 
From -q = x it follows that 0 X x must be 5. But the product of 0 and any 
number is always 0. Therefore, there is no number x that works, and divi- 
sion by 0 is undefined. 
A False Proof 
If division by 0 were allowed, it could be proved—falsely—that 1=2. Sup- 
pose x = y. Using valid properties of equations, the above equation is rewrit- 
ten 
x2 = xy (after multiplying both sides by x) 
x2 — y2 = xy — y2 (after subtracting y2 from both sides) 
(x — y)(x + y) = y(x — y) (after factoring both sides) 
(x + ?) = ? (after dividing both sides by (x — y)) 
2y = ? (x = y, based on the original supposition) 
2 = 1 (after dividing both sides by y) 
This absurd result B = 1) comes from division by 0. If x = j/, dividing by 
(x — y) is essentially dividing by 0 because x — ? = 0. 
Approaching Limits 
It is interesting to note that dividing a number such as 5 by a series of in- 
creasingly small numbers @.1, 0.01, 0.001, and so on) produces increasingly 
large numbers E0, 500, 5000, and so on). This division sequence can be 
written as — where x approaches but never equals 0. In mathematical lan- 
guage, as x approaches 0, — increases without limit or that — approaches in- 
finity, see also Consistency; Infinity; Limit.

Purer, Albrecht 
German Painter, Printmaker, and Engraver 
1471-1528 
Albrecht Durer was born in 1471 in Nuremberg, Germany, and died there 
in 1528. He is regarded as one of the leading artists of the Renaissance. His 
use of mathematical methods in artistic composition influenced subsequent 
development of art. 
Durer first worked with his father, who was an accomplished goldsmith, 
then broadened his artistic training by assisting artist Michel Wohlgemuth. 
Developing his expertise quickly, Durer was soon able to go out on his own 
as a painter and printmaker. He became widely known, traveling through- 
out Europe while studying and producing works of art, and was a particu- 
lar favorite of Emperor Maximilian I. 
Durer attempted to portray nature realistically in his works, paying close 
attention to the appearance of animals, plants, and the human body and try- 
ing to reproduce them accurately. He was even known to have dissected 
cadavers to better understand the human body. Durer's realistic paintings 
of plants influenced botanists to use drawings that more closely resembled 
the plants portrayed. 
To improve his paintings and etchings, Durer sought a mathematical 
formulation for the ideal human body and for beauty in general. He stud- 
ied the problems of space, perspective, and proportion and constructed 
his forms on the canvas, using arithmetic and geometric techniques. The 
results of his studies were published posthumously in 1528 as The Four Books 
on Human Proportions, a work that has had a significant effect on succeed- 
ing generations of artists, see also Human Body.

Earthquakes, Measuring 
Earthquakes happen every day. Thousands occur across the world every 
week. Most are not felt, but throughout history there have been many earth- 
quakes that have been very strong and caused extensive destruction. Math- 
ematics skills are invaluable to earthquake scientists, and with them they can 
sometimes predict when and where earthquakes will happen, and make mea- 
surements of earthquakes when they do occur. 
Earthquakes happen when the tectonic plates of the Earth shift. As this 
movement happens, pressure builds on the plates and faults. Eventually this 
pressure is released through an earthquake. During an earthquake seismic 
waves radiate out from a central point in all directions. There are four ba- 
sic types of seismic waves, two that travel through the Earth, and two that 
are felt at the surface. These waves are recorded on a seismograph, which 
is an instrument made up of sensitive detectors that produce a permanent 
recording. 
Size of Earthquakes 
To determine the magnitude or size of an earthquake, scientists use the 
Richter scale. Developed by Charles Richter in 1934, this scale is based on 
a logarithmic increase of magnitude. With a scale such as this, for every 
whole number increase on the scale, the amplitude of the earthquake goes 
up ten times. For example, an earthquake with a reading of 5.0 on the Richter 
scale has a magnitude 105 (or 100,000) times as great as an earthquake with 
a magnitude of zero. 
There are more than 1,000 earthquakes a day with recorded magnitudes 
of two or greater. An earthquake measuring between 6.1 and 6.9 can cause 
destruction in an area up to 100 kilometers in diameter. The San Francisco 
earthquake of 1906 measured 7.8 on the Richter scale. 
Another way to measure an earthquake is to use the Mercalli Intensity 
Scale. This scale measures the intensity or energy of an earthquake. Though 
each earthquake has a fixed magnitude, the effects of it are different de- 
pending on location. This measurement is based on criteria such as struc- 
tural damage and the observations of people who felt the earthquake. From 
these types of observations, the intensity of an earthquake can be estimated. 
The Mercalli scale is not considered as scientific as the Richter scale, 
since it is based on factors that can change depending on where the infor- 
tectonic plates large

tion to one another

MAJOR QUAKE LIKELY TO 
STRIKE BETWEEN 2000 
AND 2030 
Scientists believe that there is 
an 80-percent probability of at 
least one earthquake with a 
Richter magnitude between 6.0 
and 6.6 striking the San Fran- 
cisco Bay region before 2030.

threats, people can make

prepare for future quakes. 
mation is derived. After an earthquake, for example, witnesses may exag- 
gerate or not agree on what they saw. In addition damage does not always 
accurately measure the strength of an earthquake. 
Depth and Location of Earthquakes 
Earthquakes occur between the Earth's surface and about 700 kilometers 
below the surface. The way to determine the depth of an earthquake is to 
look at wave characteristics on a seismogram, which is a graph of seismic 
waves. For example, an indication of a large earthquake with a deep focus 
would be surface waves with small amplitudes, and uncomplicated deep 
waves. 
The point on Earth's surface directly above the origin of an earthquake 
is called its epicenter. To find out where an earthquake is located, scien- 
tists must examine its waves. The simplest method is to look at the differ- 
ent arrival times of wave types at multiple seismograph stations. Scientists 
then use standard travel-time tables and travel-time curves to find the dis- 
tance to the earthquake from each station. Arcs are then drawn, with the 
distance from each station to the earthquake used as a radius. The point 
where all the arcs intersect is the epicenter of the earthquake. 
Calculating Earthquake Odds 
Earthquakes are naturally recurring events, and scientists continue to de- 
velop better methods to predict when and where earthquakes might hap- 
pen.^ Earthquake probabilities are based on balancing the continual 
motions of the Earth's plates with the slip on faults, which occurs primar- 
ily during earthquakes. Scientists must also look at the history of a given 
fault to know when it last ruptured, potential quake sizes, and the rate at 
which the plate is moving. By combining geology, physics, and statistics, 
scientists continue to become more accurate in their earthquake predictions.

Economic Indicators 
Individuals and families have checking accounts, savings accounts, credit 
cards, and bills, so people make budgets to determine how much money 
they are making and spending. Businesses do the same thing. Countries, 
such as the United States, also use a budget to keep close track of their fi- 
nances. The study of money and where it is going and where it came from 
Economic Indicators 
is called economics. The economy is the system through which money cir- 
culates. Economists are the people who study the movement of money 
through the economy. By looking at economic indicators (which are fea- 
tures of the economy that are represented in numbers) economists make 
predictions about the potential strengths and weaknesses in the economy. 
Economic indicators give economists valuable insights into a country's fi- 
nancial standing. 
Leading Indicators 
Leading economic indicators are those that have the ability to forecast the 
probable future economy. An example of a leading indicator is the length 
of the workweek; that is, the average number of hours employees work in 
a week. As business increases, employers generally increase the number of 
hours that current employees work instead of immediately hiring new em- 
ployees. A longer workweek tells economists that businesses are doing well. 
If business is increasing, the economy is doing well. If, on the other hand, 
the economy is doing poorly, employers will shorten their employees' work- 
week before laying off employees, a measure which is, for most employers, 
used only as a last effort to save money. Since the workweek lengthens or 
shortens before any effects on the economy are seen, a change in the length 
of the workweek in either direction can be used as a forecasting tool for 
economists. 
Lagging Indicators 
Other economic indicators result from changes in various features of the 
economy. An example of a lagging indicator is the unemployment rate, which 
is the number that represents the percentage of the labor force that is not 
employed. The labor force is defined as all people over 16 years of age who 
are able to work. However, it does not include stay-at-home mothers or fa- 
thers, students, people who cannot work because of their health, or people 
who are not looking for jobs. If many people are unemployed, the economy 
is doing poorly. If few people are unemployed, the economy is doing well. 
Since change in the unemployment rate tells how many people either lost 
or gained jobs, it simply describes what has already happened; it does not 
predict what might happen. 
Numbers in the Economy 
Most of the numbers used to calculate economic indicators come from the 
U.S. Census Bureau, which is the division of the U.S. Department of Com- 
merce that keeps statistics, such as the unemployment rate, the workweek 
length, the number of new houses being built, the number of building per- 
mits being given out, the number of new jobs being created, as well as many 
other figures. All of these statistics are used to provide economists with the 
data they need to study the economy. Economists are most concerned with 
changes in these statistics, which raises questions such as "Are there more 
new jobs being created this year than last year?" or "Are people working 
fewer hours this month than last month?" 
The numbers for economic indicators are often put into indexes. In- 
dexes are combinations of data from different economic indicators. The in- 
dex numbers provide a broader view of the economy. One of the most 
frequently used numbers is the index of leading economic indicators (LEI). 
..* 
Interest rates on credit 
cards vary from lender to 
lender and from person 
to person, depending on 
one's credit history. 
Smart consumers shop 
around to find the best 
rates available. 
Economic Indicators 
This index measures changes in several leading economic indicators. An in- 
crease in the LEI for 3 or more months signals that the economy is im- 
proving; a decrease in the LEI for 3 or more months suggests a possible 
recession. A recession is a temporary decrease in business and therefore a 
downturn in the economy. 
Gross Domestic Product 
One of the best indicators of the economy is the gross domestic product 
(GDP). This dollar figure is the value of all goods and services produced 
within a nation in a calendar year. The gross national product (GNP) is also 
a dollar figure, but differs in that it is the value of all goods and services 
produced by a nation's citizens within a year. For example, the profits from 
an American-owned business operating in Germany would be included in 
the GNP, but not in the GDP because the business is not within the United 
States. The gross domestic product (GDP) is more commonly used as an 
economic indicator. 
Goods that are included in the GDP must be newly manufactured items, 
and they must be finished products. In making an automobile, first a man- 
ufacturer makes the steel and sells it to the auto manufacturer. At this stage 
the steel is not counted in the GDP because it is not a finished product. 
The steel is counted in the GDP only as part of the value of the finished 
automobile. 
The goods and services counted in the GDP consist not only of the 
things that people buy: They can be things that people produce that get 
consumed without ever being sold. One example is a farmer who milks cows. 
If the farmer then drinks some of the milk he or she produces, it is still 
counted in the GDP, even though it was never sold. Economists will guess 
at its market value (its worth) and add it to the total GDP. If milk sells for 
$2.50 per gallon at the time and it is estimated that the farmer's family drank 
100 gallons of milk during the year, $250 would be added to the GDP. In 
this sense, the GDP is not a precise measurement. 
Information for calculating the GDP is collected every quarter (i.e., 
every 3 months). The GDP in each quarter is multiplied by 4 to calculate 
an "annual GDP." Economists often adjust the GDP even further. Since 
seasonal changes affect the economy, economists often make adjustments 
for the seasons of the year. In the summer, for example, tourism increases 
and more money is spent. Instead of saying that the GDP is higher in the 
summer, economists adjust it so it is standard throughout the year. They do 
this by looking at the change in the GDP over several summers. For ex- 
ample, if the average change every summer is an increase of 3 percent, but 
one summer it increased 5 percent, it will only be said to have increased 2 
percent above "normal." 
fluctuate to vary irregu- Because prices fluctuate from year to year, another adjustment must be 
1??|? made to the GDP in order to allow economists to compare GDPs from dif- 
ferent years. Most products, such as cars, homes, and clothing cost more 
now than they did 20 years ago. Therefore a dollar today purchases a dif- 
ferent amount of product than it did in the past. To account for this, econ- 
omists calculate each year's GDP in constant dollars. Constant dollars 
measure the value of products in a given year based on the prices of prod- 
ucts in some base year. For example, in the early-1990s, economists used 
1983 as a base year to convert to constant dollars. When economists refer 
Economic Indicators 
to constant dollars, the base year is often stated. By doing this, the change 
in the GDP from year to year is due to the change in the amount of goods 
and services being produced. 
Inflation 
Economists use the inflation rate to help them adjust the GDP to constant 
dollars. Inflation is the rate, expressed as a percentage, at which prices of 
goods and services are increasing each year. It may be reported on the news 
that "in March prices increased 1 percent, an annual inflation rate of 12 per- 
cent." The annual rate is calculated by multiplying the rate for the month 
times 12. But the annual rate of inflation for that year will only be 12 per- 
cent if prices continue to increase 1 percent per month for the rest of the 
year. Inflation rates may also be given as "the year's inflation." This does 
not mean an annual rate but a rate since January of that year. In the pre- 
ceding example, the months included would be January, February, and 
March. It is important to understand the concept of inflation as well as the 
means by which it is reported. 
The following example converts the GDP in 1980 to constant 1972 dol- 
lars. First, think of the base year A972) prices as 1.0. By 1980, prices in the 
United States had increased to 1.8, an 80 percent increase since 1972. The 
GDP (in 1980 dollars) in 1980 was $2.62 trillion dollars. To change this to 
1972 dollars, divide it by 1.8. This gives the constant dollar GDP of $1.45 
trillion. This number is significantly lower than the current dollar GDP of 
1980. However, it allows economists to compare the economy from year to 
year more accurately. 
Consumer Price Index 
Inflation is determined by the Consumer Price Index, which is a measure- 
ment of price increase. Surveyors from the U.S. Labor Department collect 
information from households around the country about what goods are be- 
ing purchased and consumed. Beyond knowing how much a household is 
spending, for example, on groceries or entertainment, analysts determine 
how much is being spent on specific items, such as eggs, milk, and movie 
rentals. All of the information collected from the surveyors is then averaged. 
The result provides the Labor Department with a representative budget for 
an average household. 
The surveyors then price all of the items that are in that representative 
budget every month. They can compare the prices each month to find out 
how much they have changed. The rate at which they change is inflation. 
It is important to recalculate the consumer price index periodically because 
of the changing habits of consumers. 
These economic indicators are only a few of the many that economists 
study every day. However, these indicators are the ones that are most often 
reported to the public and the ones that most directly affect consumers. For 
example, inflation rates, which may affect the interest rate a consumer must 
pay on a car loan or mortgage, are used to adjust interest rates. As inflation 
rates rise, so do interest rates, thus affecting consumers' purchasing power. 
A basic understanding of economics and economic indicators is essential in 
sound financial management, see also Agriculture; Stock Market.

American Physicist and Mathematician 
1879-1955 
Albert Einstein is perhaps the best-known scientist who ever lived. His con- 
tributions include the special and general theories of relativity, the asser- 
tion of the equivalence of mass and energy, and the quantum explanation 
of the behavior of electromagnetic radiation, including light. Einstein was 
born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879 and died in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1955. 
Einstein showed little academic ability before entering the Federal Poly- 
technic Academy in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1896, where he studied both 
mathematics and physics. After graduating in 1900, he briefly taught school 
and then took a position in the patent office. During this time, he wrote ar- 
ticles on theoretical physics in his spare time. 
Einstein's ability to apply advanced mathematics in the solution of com- 
plex physical problems led to the publication of a group of momentous pa- 
pers in 1905. A doctorate from the University of Zurich and world fame 
soon followed. 
The subjects of the 1905 publications included special relativity, the 
equivalence of matter and energy, and the quantum nature of radiation. 
These revolutionary publications, in combination with the general theory 
of relativity, which he published in 1915, and the development of quantum 
mechanics, to which he made significant contributions, transformed science 
and again demonstrated the indispensability of mathematics in the scientific 
endeavor. 
The atomic age, the space age, and the electronic age owe much to Ein- 
stein's contributions to physics, changing human civilization more dramat- 
ically in the twentieth century than in previous centuries combined.

Electronics Repair Technician 
Modern life is powered by electricity, but electrical equipment sometimes 
breaks down. Electronics repair technicians can troubleshoot a piece of mal- 
functioning equipment and repair it. They can also test and maintain equip- 
ment to keep it from breaking down at all. 
End of the World, Predictions of 
"Electronics" is a broad category, and electronics repair technicians find 
jobs in a number of settings and can pursue any range of specializations, in- 
cluding heating and air conditioning, home appliances, computers, and 
telecommunications, among others. Some electronics repair technicians 
even specialize in musical instruments such as electric guitars. While hands- 
on experience is important, most electronics repair technicians find that en- 
try and advancement in the job market are easier if they have a strong math 
and science background in high school from classes such as physics, 
algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. It is also helpful to have a two-year de- 
gree in electronics technology from a community college or vocational- 
technical college. Such a program emphasizes not only electronics, but also 
applied mathematics and geometry. Although it is not mandatory, many pass 
an exam to be become certified. 
Good electronics repair technicians have a firm grasp of the mathematics 
and physics of electricity. They have to measure and understand electrical 
charges, currents and amps, voltage, and resistance. They must be familiar 
with Ohm's law, which is the relationship between current, voltage, and re- 
sistance. An electronic repair technician should understand the structure and 
operation of electrical components, including resistors, capacitors, diodes, 
transistors, integrated circuits, and switches. In addition, they need to read 
and understand schematic diagrams, which visually present "outlines" of 
circuits, showing how electrical components connect, see also Boole, 
George.

End of the World, Predictions of 
Keeping track of time has been an integral activity of every civilization, no 
matter how primitive. There are ample indications that even civilizations in 
pre-historic times made concerted attempts to measure time. Many civi- 
lizations, including the Mayan, and individuals, such as Stifel in sixteenth- 
century Germany, used measurements of time to predict the end of the 
world. 
Keeping Track of Time 
For early civilizations, keeping track of time involved two distinct pursuits: 
food and religion. The cycles for planting and harvesting could be antici- 
pated and planned for with a calendar. Primitive societies could also plan 
for bird and animal migrations in advance of their arrival. In both cases, 
even a primitive calendar could help communities grow crops and hunt game 
in a better, more organized manner.

The religious aspect of keeping time was tied to the worship of the heav- 
ens. Ancient peoples viewed the motions of heavenly bodies and related phe- 
nomena, such as an eclipse of the moon, as acts of the gods that were 
important to predict. Archeologists think the standing stones of Stonehenge 
in England were a massive observatory that ancient peoples used to track 
the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstice. It also 
appears that they used Stonehenge to keep track of lunar eclipses. The abil- 
ity to keep time and predict heavenly phenomena strengthened the hold that 
the religious class had over its followers. 
Today's calendar is derived, in part, from the calendar used by ancient 
Sumerians and Babylonians. In approximately 3000 to 4000 B.C.E., these 
Middle Eastern peoples invented a written alphabet and a fairly accurate 
calendar. The Babylonians used a lunar calendar, which consisted of twelve 
lunar months of 29 or 30 days each, depending on the motion of the moon. 
The total number of days in their year was only 354 days. Religious feast 
days were added to some of the months to bring the total to 360 days. 
This total of 360 days fit in well with the Babylonian mathematics of 
the times. Their number system was based on the number 60, in contrast 
to the modern-day number system, which is a decimal, or base-10, system. 
The 360-day year also accommodated Babylonian astrology. 
In Babylonian astrology, the year was divided into twelve parts, each de- 
voted to a god who was personified by the movement of various constella- 
tions in the heavens. The 360-day year was still 5 days shorter than the 
actual length of a year, so the Babylonians added a festival of 5 days at the 
end of the year to bring the total to 365 days. 
Many cultures that followed the Babylonians adopted their 365-day year. 
This was still incorrect because a year is now known to be 365.2422 days. 
As a result, calendars descended from the Babylonian calendar required fre- 
quent adjustments, and the calendar for many cultures was constantly be- 
ing revised to make up for lost or gained days. 
The present calendar went through several refinements from its begin- 
ning during the Roman Empire. It was not until 1582 that a commission 
under Pope Gregory IX developed our present-day calendar, with an accu- 
racy that will not need any revision for at least 3,000 years. 
Around the year 500 C.E. the Mayas of Central America were using a 
calendar that is still more accurate than our calendar of today. The Mayan 
calendar^ was used exclusively by the priestly classes and consisted of a rit- 
ual cycle of 260 individually named days and a yearly calendar of 365 days. 
The ritual cycle lasted 20 months, each month containing 13 days B0 X 
13 = 260). The yearly calendar, or tun, contained 18 months of 20 days 
each A8 X 20 = 360), with a final month of 5 days added at the end of 
the year. 
The Mayas also adjusted their calendar periodically, according to solar 
eclipses and observations of Venus. The two Mayan calendar cycles ran at 
the same time, and a named day would fall on the same day of the year every 
18,980 days or every 52 years. This 52-year cycle is called a calendar round. 
The calendar round was not used to indicate the specific year during 
which an event took place. Instead, the event was placed in a "long count."

baktun, and finally 13 baktuns make a "Great Cycle" of 1,872,000 days, or 
about 5,130 years. 
According to Mayan tradition, the present creation is the fifth such cre- 
ation of the gods. The gods were dissatisfied with their first four attempts 
to create mankind and destroyed each of the first four creations after a pe- 
riod of time called a long count. The fifth creation took place in 3133 B.C.E., 
and the present long count started at that time. This long count will expire 
on December 24, 2011. At that time, the gods will declare themselves ei- 
ther pleased with mankind or will destroy the world and begin again, start- 
ing the clock for a new long count. 
Predicting the End of the World 
Since the time of the ancient Babylonians, many individuals and cultures 
have looked to the heavens and to astrology to predict the future. Many 
mathematicians earned their living by casting horoscopes, including Jerome 
Cardano A501-1576) and Johann Kepler A571-1630). 
During the sixteenth century, several mathematicians applied their 
knowledge of mathematics to questionable Bible scholarship and dubious 
Biblical interpretation to predict the exact date for the end of the world. Af- 
ter a careful study of the Bible and mathematics, German mathematician 
Michael Stifel A486-1567) predicted a date for the end of the world. 
Stifel was an educated man, who graduated with a degree in mathe- 
matics from the University of Wittenberg. He was a monk at a Catholic 
monastery for a time after graduation but eventually joined Protestant leader 
Martin Luther, even staying at Luther's house in Wittenberg. Soon after 
joining with Luther, Stifel began to apply his mathematics to the Bible. Af- 
ter some careful study, Stifel determined that a hidden message in the Bible 
revealed that the world would end on October 3, 1533. 
When the fateful day arrived, Stifel gathered his small group of believ- 
ers from the town of Lochau to the top of a hill to await the end of the 
world and their deliverance into heaven. As the morning wore on and noth- 
ing happened, some of the believers began to get worried. Soon most of the 
believers were anxiously questioning Stifel. At about midday, Stifel excused 
himself and hurried to town where he was put into a jail cell for protection 
against his now angry believers, many of whom sold houses and farms in 
expectation of the world's end. Eventually Stifel was able to leave town safely. 
In time, he gained Luther's forgiveness in return for a promise to never 
again apply mathematics to Biblical matters. 
A more famous mathematician from the same time period also predicted 
a date for the world's end. Scottish mathematician John Napier A550-1617) 
was a nobleman who spent nearly all his life in Scotland. Napier was an able 
mathematician, who was also active in religious controversies of the times. 
In fact, he devoted more time to his religious studies than to his mathe- 
matics. He was a zealous supporter of the Protestant cause. 
After 27 years of writing, Napier published The Plaine Discovery of the 
Whole Revelation of St. John. In it, he identified the Pope as the Antichrist. In 
Discovery, he also predicted that the end of the world would happen between 
1688 and 1700. In this prediction, Napier had the good fortune to select a

day far beyond his life span. When his prediction failed to come true, he 
avoided the humiliation that had come to Stifel some 75 years earlier. 
More recently, William Miller predicted the world would end on Oc- 
tober 22, 1844. Thousands of believers were disappointed when the proph- 
esied end did not come, but many shifted their belief to a future, unspecified 
time when the end would come. 
While most predictions of the world's end today come from religious 
groups, there are scientists who are making such predictions about the 
world's end. Their predictions are based on our present knowledge of stars, 
such as the Sun. Our Sun has a finite life and eventually will burn out. When 
might such an event occur? The best estimates are that the core of the Sun 
will collapse in approximately 5 billion years. The resulting increase in tem- 
perature of the Sun's core will ultimately end all life on Earth. However, 
like Napier, the scientists making these estimates will not live to see whether 
their predictions come true, see also Calendar, Numbers in the; Time,

Endangered Species, Measuring 
The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is one of the most important and 
controversial legislative acts in recent years. This law requires the use of 
specific measures to protect certain species of plants or animals that are listed 
as threatened species or endangered species. Before a species is listed as 
threatened or endangered, biologists must determine if a viable population 
of the plant or animal in question exists in the wild. This usually means de- 
termining the number of existing individuals, the sex of each, the number 
within breeding age, the breeding success rate, mortality rates, birth rates, 
whether sufficient genetic diversity exists, and many other factors. To an- 
swer these questions, the number of plants or animals must be counted. 
Study Methods Used to Estimate Population Size 
Study methods include observation and photography, live trapping, and 
transect sampling. All of the methods result in an estimate of the number 
of individuals in the population. This number is then compared with what 
is considered a minimum viable population, which is the smallest number 
of individuals of a species in a particular area that can survive and maintain 
genetic diversity. 
Endangered Species, Measuring 
Observation and Photography. These are the simplest study methods. 
Observation and photography involve going into an area known to contain 
individuals from the population in question and simply counting how many 
can be found. This method works well for species that are not very mobile. 
For example, there is a species of snail that inhabits a small area on one 
mountain slope. This area is so small that one person can count the num- 
ber of individuals present. In other cases, the number of individuals is so 
small that the entire population can be counted. Whooping cranes exist in 
such small numbers that the entire population is known from yearly cen- 
suses made on both the cranes's wintering grounds and their breeding 
grounds. Whooping cranes can be counted from observation towers, or they 
can be photographed from low flying airplanes or helicopters. 
Observation can involve senses other than vision. Estimates of bird pop- 
ulations are often made by listening to singing males. The songs are dis- 
tinctive enough that the species can be identified from their song. 
Knowledge of their breeding success, the number of offspring per pair, and 
mortality rates can then be used to determine if the population is viable. 
Live Trapping. Sometimes population estimates are made by placing traps 
in the area being studied. The number of animals captured is then related 
back to the total number of animals in the area. Live trapping generally does 
not harm the animals, and it has the advantage of allowing the researcher to 
gather other information about the species, such as age, sex, and health. In- 
dividuals can also be marked so that their movements can be followed. Birds 
trapped in this way are commonly banded. Bird banding has given biologists 
and wildlife managers extensive information about bird migration patterns. 
Transect Sampling. Transect sampling is a standard statistical technique 
for determining the population in an area. The researcher or surveyor walks 
along a straight line (called a transect) through the area of interest and counts 
every individual that can be seen. Alternatively, the researcher may observe 
other evidence of the presence of an animal (such as droppings). Under ideal 
conditions, the number of individuals observed within the transect area has 
the same proportion to the total number of individuals within the total area. 
Suppose a surveyor walks across the area A along the transect L. At some 
time, the surveyor will be at point Z, and may see an individual at X. The 
width of the strip that can be seen by the surveyor is 2 W, and the distance 
of the animal or plant from the surveyor is r{. The angle from the transect 
line to the observed animal or plant is 0?. The perpendicular distance from 
the transect line to the observed individual is y{. Note that j/, = r{ sin 0?. 
When one thinks of 
endangered or threatened 
species, one often thinks 
first of animals such as 
pandas or eagles. How- 
ever, plants—like this 
species of fringed 
orchid—may also fall 
under the protection of 
the Endangered Species 
Act.

The mathematical model for estimating the size of a population from 
transect data depends on two assumptions: A) not all individuals will be de- 
tected and B) the probability of detecting an individual decreases as its per- 
pendicular distance from the transect line increases. These two assumptions 
are generally expressed as a detection function, g(y), which represents the 
probability that an individual will be observed at a distance x from the tran- 
sect line. The function g(y) decreases as ? increases. Generally, estimating 
detection functions requires calculus. However, the result is an effective 
width, a, of the transect area that is different from the actual width. Once 
a is known, the population density is given by D = —— where n is the num- 
ber of individuals observed, and L is the length of the transect. The basic 
problem in estimating population density is estimating the parameter a. 
The parameter a can be estimated accurately by choosing an appropriate 
probability density function/(y) = %?-. Division by a makes the proba- 
bility density function equal to one, which is what is expected of probability 
functions. Candidate choices for f(y) include Fourier series, exponential 
power series, and negative exponentials. 
The critical assumption permitting estimation from distance data is that 
all objects located directly on the line (distance = 0) are certain to be de- 
tected, so g@) = 1. If g@) = 1, then/@) = —. The equation for estimat-

ing population density can now be rewritten in terms of ??): D = \ • 
The estimator function/@) can usually be determined by trial and error or 
by one of several different mathematical models available. Wildlife man- 
agers commonly use computer programs that have the various mathemati- 
cal models and estimator functions included. 
Determining if a Species Has a Minimum 
Viable Population 
Once the size of the population has been estimated, researchers must then 
decide if the population is healthy and can survive on its own, or if it is too 
small to be viable and requires protection. There are various methods of es- 
timating viability of a population. 
One method often used by biologists to estimate the viability of a popu- 
lation of vertebrates is the 50/500 rule. The minimum number of individuals 
in a breeding population required to prevent an unacceptable level of in- 
breeding is 50. The number of breeding individuals required for the long- 
term genetic variability necessary for a healthy population is 500. This rule is 
established by assuming that a mature male and a mature female are randomly 
drawn and randomly paired. However, in many populations, one male may 
dominate a large group of females, excluding other males from the genetic 
pool. In this and similar cases, a larger population is needed for viability. 
Since not all individuals in a population are active breeders, the census 
population must be at least twice as large as the breeding population. Many 
researchers use a census population of 1,000 to 10,000 individuals as the 
minimum necessary for long-term genetic viability. 
Other Factors Affecting Minimum Viable Population. When rules such 
as the 50/500 method are not applicable or when greater precision is de- 
Endangered Species, Measuring 
sired, one of several analytic approaches to calculating the Minumum Vi- 
able Population may be used. One analytic factor to be considered is the sex 
ratio. If the percentage of males is 50 percent, then the sex ratio is not 
skewed. However, in many populations the fraction of males can be larger 
or smaller than 50 percent. In these groups, larger census populations are 
necessary. 
Another factor affecting the size of the census population is the average 
number of offspring. If a certain species typically produces many offspring, 
the census population can increase quite rapidly. Relative birth and death 
rates can also be used to predict population increase or decrease. 
Simulations. None of the preceding approaches has been completely sat- 
isfactory in estimating populations and as a result, simulations have been 
suggested as an alternative. Simulations are computer programs that attempt 
to model population dynamics. Some are applicable to many different pop- 
ulations, while others have been developed for specific situations, such as a 
program to estimate the population of the grizzly bears of Yellowstone Na- 
tional Park. 
The Endangered Species Act 
The ultimate goal of counting specific species may be to determine if they 
should be listed as threatened or endangered. The first endangered species 
legislation was enacted in 1966. This act established a list of animals that 
were threatened with extinction. However, federal agencies were limited in 
their ability to protect these species. The most significant part of this first 
act was the establishment of the National Wildlife Refuge System, which 
was designed to protect the habitats of endangered species. 
In 1969 the U.S. Congress passed the Endangered Species Conservation 
Act. This act included invertebrates as well as vertebrates. It also restricted 
interstate commerce in illegally taken animals. In 1973 the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA) was passed. The ESA has been called the most compre- 
hensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by 
any nation. Since 1973, the ESA has been reauthorized and amended twice. 
Under the ESA, two departments have the sole authority to list species: 
The National Marine Fisheries Service is authorized to list marine mammals 
and fish, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists all other species. This 
division of responsibility between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the 
U.S. Department of the Interior has caused some difficulties in the consistent 
application of rules and criteria for listing species. The act was amended in 
1982 to state that listing should be based solely on biological criteria. 
The ESA identifies two different population conditions related to the 
viability of species. "Threatened" species are those whose populations are 
still viable, but may be declining or have a limited habitat, and therefore 
be in danger of becoming threatened. "Endangered" species have popula- 
tions that are too small to be considered viable and thus are in danger of 
becoming extinct, see also Statistical Analysis.

Escher, IVL ? 
Dutch Artist 
1898-1972 
Maurits Cornelis Escher was born in Leeuwarden, Holland, in 1898. He 
enrolled in the School for Architecture and Decorative Arts in Haarlem be- 
cause his father, a civil engineer, wanted him to become an architect. Es- 
cher, however, left school in 1922 to pursue his interest in art. He married 
in 1924 and moved to Rome where he lived until 1934. Growing political 
tension in Europe caused him to move his family first to Switzerland, then 
to Belgium, and finally back to the Netherlands in 1941. He remained there 
until his death in 1972. 
Mathematics in Art 
Escher's art is of particular interest to mathematicians because, although he 
received no mathematical training beyond his early years, he used a variety 
of mathematical principles in unique and fascinating ways. Escher's artwork 
encompasses two broad areas: the geometry of space, and the so-called 
"logic" of space. 
On a visit to the Alhambra in Spain, Escher was inspired by the color- 
ful geometrical patterns of tiles. He began to explore the various ways of 
filling two-dimensional space with symmetrically repeated arrangements of 
images known as tessellations. In the process, he discovered the same prin- 
ciples that had been developed previously, unknown to Escher, within the 
branch of mathematics known as group theory. \ATien mathematicians and 
scientists became aware of his work, they helped popularize his art, and he 
soon gained an international reputation. 
Subsequent interactions with mathematicians introduced Escher to 
other mathematical concepts that he explored in his art. Among the results 
are his so-called impossible constructions that appear reasonable but prove 
to be impossible to construct in three-dimensional space. He also employed 
non-Euclidean geometry, representations of infinite space, and various as- 
pects of topology. 
Although Escher completed his final graphic work in 1969, the popu- 
larity of his images continues today. Several Internet sites are dedicated to 
providing information about Escher and selling renditions of his art. see

Estimation 
Adding, multiplying, and performing similar mathematical operations in 
one's head can be difficult tasks, even for the most skilled mathematics stu- 
dents. By estimating, however, basic operations are easier to calculate men- 
tally. This can make daily calculation tasks, from figuring tips to monthly 
budgets, quickly attainable and understandable. 
How to Estimate 
Although the core of estimation is rounding, place value (for example, round- 
ing to the nearest hundreds) makes estimating flexible and useful. For in- 
stance, calculating 2.4 + 13.7 - 10.8 + 8 - 124.2 - 32 to equal -142.9 
in one's head may be a daunting task. But if the equation is estimated by 
10s, that is, if each number is rounded to the nearest 10, the problem 
becomes 0+ 10- 10+ 10- 120- 30, and it is easier to calculate its 
value at —140. Estimating to the Is makes the equation 2 + 14 — 11 + 
8 — 124 — 32 = —143, which is more accurate but more difficult to calcu- 
late mentally. Note that the smaller the place value used, the closer the es- 
timation is to the actual sum. 
Estimation by Tens 
Multiplication and division can be estimated with any place value, but es- 
timating by 10s is usually the quickest method. For example, the product 
8 X 1,294 = 10,352 can be estimated by 10s as 10 X 1,290 = 12,900, 
which is calculated with little effort. Division is similar in that estimating 
by 10s allows for the quickest calculation, even with decimals. For instance, 
1,232.322 ¦? 12.2 = 101.01 is quicker to estimate by 10s as 1,230.0 + 
10.0 = 123.0. 
Regardless of the ease of estimating by 10s, there is a greater degree of 
inaccuracy as compared to estimating by Is. However, this estimation 
method need not be abandoned in order to gain accuracy; instead, it can be 
used to obtain estimations that are more accurate, as the following example 
illustrates. 
Suppose a couple on a date enjoys a dinner that costs $24.32. The cus- 
tomary tip is 15 percent, but the couple does not have a calculator, tip table, 
or pencil to help figure the amount that should be added to the bill. Using 
the estimating-by-lOs method, they figure that 15 percent of $10 is $1.50; 
if the bill is around $20, then the tip doubles to $3. However, a $3 tip is 
not enough because they have not included tip for the $4.32 remaining on 
the bill. Yet if $1.50 is the tip for $10, then $0.75 would be an appropriate 
tip for $5, which is near enough to $4.32. A total estimated tip of $3.75 is 
rounding process of 
giving an approximate 
number 
Estimation 
close (in fact, an overestimation) to 15 percent of $24.32, which is $3.65 
(rounded to the nearest cent). 
Conservative Estimation 
As seen in several of the examples, estimations tend to be more (an overes- 
timation) or less (an underestimation) than the actual calculation. Whether 
this is important depends upon the situation. For example, overestimating 
the distance for a proposed trip may be a good idea, especially in figuring 
how much gas money will be needed. 
This property of rounding and estimation is the foundation of conser- 
vative estimation found in financial planning. When constructing a monthly 
budget, financial planners will purposely underestimate income and overes- 
timate expenses, usually by hundreds. Although an accurate budget seems 
ideal, this estimating technique creates a "cushion" for unexpected changes, 
such as a higher water bill or fewer hours worked. Furthermore, financial 
planners will round down (regardless of rounding rules) for underestima- 
tion and round up for overestimation. 
The following table represents a sample budget for an individual. The 
first column includes amounts expected to pay; the second is a conservative 
estimate of the next month's budget; the third is a list of the actual amounts 
incurred; and the fourth is the difference between actual and budgeted 
amounts. Note that negative numbers, or amounts that take away from in- 
come, are written in parentheses. 
The table shows that the individual earned less than expected and in 
some cases spent more than expected. Nevertheless, because the budget is 
conservative, there is a surplus (money left over) at the end of the month.

Estimation by Average 
Counting the number of words on a page can be a tedious task. Therefore, 
writers often estimate the total by averaging the number of words on the 
first few lines and then multiplying that average by the number of lines on 
the page. 
Another application of estimation by average is the classic game of guess- 
ing how many jellybeans are in a jar. The trick is to average the number of 
beans on the top and bottom layers and then to multiply that average by 
the number of layers in the jar. Because it is customary to declare a winner 
Euclid and His Contributions 
who guessed the closest but not over the actual count, it is best to estimate 
conservatively. 
Estimation is a powerful skill that can be applied to tasks from proofing 
arithmetic to winning a counting game. However, the use of estimation is 
not always appropriate to the task. For example, estimating distance and di- 
rection of space debris and ships is unwise, since even the smallest decimal 
difference can mean life or death. In addition, technology makes it possible 
to add and multiply large groups of numbers faster than it may take to esti- 
mate the total. Nevertheless, estimation is an important tool in managing the 
everyday mathematics of life, see also Financial Planner; Rounding.

Euclid and His Contributions 
Euclid was an ancient Greek mathematician from Alexandria who is best 
known for his major work, Elements. Although little is known about Euclid 
the man, he taught in a school that he founded in Alexandria, Egypt, around 
300 B.C.E. 
For his major study, Elements, Euclid collected the work of many math- 
ematicians who preceded him. Among these were Hippocrates of Chios, 
Theudius, Theaetetus, and Eudoxus. Euclid's vital contribution was to 
gather, compile, organize, and rework the mathematical concepts of his 
predecessors into a consistent whole, later to become known as Euclidean 
geometry. 
In Euclid's method, deductions are made from premises or axioms. This 
deductive method, as modified by Aristotle, was the sole procedure used for 
demonstrating scientific certitude ("truth") until the seventeenth century. 
At the time of its introduction, Elements was the most comprehensive 
and logically rigorous examination of the basic principles of geometry. It 
survived the eclipse of classical learning, which occurred with the fall of the 
Roman Empire, through Arabic translations. Elements was reintroduced to 
Europe in 1120 C.E. when Adelard of Bath translated an Arabic version into 
Latin. Over time, it became a standard textbook in many societies, includ- 
ing the United States, and remained widely used until the mid-nineteenth 
century. Much of the information in it still forms a part of many high school 
geometry curricula. 
Axiomatic Systems 
To understand Euclid's Elements, one must first understand the concept of 
an axiomatic system. Mathematics is often described as being based solely 
on logic, meaning that statements are accepted as fact only if they can be 
logically deduced from other statements known to be true. 
What does it mean for a statement to be "known to be true?" Such a 
statement could, of course, be deduced from some other "known" statement. 
However, there must be some set of statements, called axioms, that are sim-

true given that certain 
assumptions and defini- 
tions (called axioms) 
are accepted as true 
ply assumed to be true. Without axioms, no chain of deductions could ever 
begin. Thus even mathematics begins with certain unproved assumptions. 
Ideally, in any axiomatic system, the assumptions are of such a basic and 
intuitive nature that their truth can be accepted without qualms. Yet axioms 
must be strong enough, or true enough, that other basic statements can be 
proved from them. 
Definitions are also part of an axiomatic system, as are undefined terms 
(certain words whose definitions must be assumed in order for other words 
to be defined based on them). Thus an axiomatic system consists of the fol- 
lowing: a collection of undefined terms; a collection of definitions; a col- 
lection of axioms (also called postulates); and, finally, a collection of 
theorems. Theorems are statements that are proved by the logical conclu- 
sion of a combination of axioms, definitions, and undefined terms. 
Euclid's Axioms 
In the Elements, Euclid attempted to bring together the various geometric 
facts known in his day (including some that he discovered himself) in order 
to form an axiomatic system, in which these "facts" could be subjected to 
rigorous proof. His undefined terms were point, line, straight line, surface, 
and plane. (To Euclid, the word "line" meant any finite curve, and hence a 
"straight" line is what we would call a line segment.) 
Euclid divided his axioms into two categories, calling the first five pos- 
tulates and the next five "common notions." The distinction between pos- 
tulates and common notions is that the postulates are geometric in 
character, whereas common notions were considered by Euclid to be true 
in general. 
Euclid's axioms follow. 
1. It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any point. 
2. It is possible to extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight 
line. (In modern terminology, this says that a line segment can be ex- 
tended past either of its endpoints to form an arbitrarily large line 
segment.) 
3. It is possible to create a circle with any center and distance (radius). 
4. All right angles are equal to one another. (A right angle is, by Eu- 
clid's definition, "half of a straight angle: that is, if a line segment 
has one of its endpoints on another line segment and divides the sec- 
ond segment into two angles that are equal to each other, the two 
equal angles are called right angles.) 
5. If a straight line falling on (crossing) two straight lines makes the in- 
terior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two 
straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which 
the angles are less than the two right angles. 
6. Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. 
7. If equals are added to equals, the wholes (sums) are equal. 
8. If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders (differences) are 
equal. 
Euclid and His Contributions 
9. Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another. 
10. The whole is greater than the part. 
It was Euclid's intent that all the remaining geometric statements in the El- 
ements be logical consequences of these ten axioms. 
In the two millennia that have followed the first publication of the El- 
ements, logical gaps have been found in some of Euclid's arguments, and 
places have been identified where Euclid uses an assumption that he never 
explicitly states. However, although quite a few of his arguments have needed 
improvement, the great majority of his results are sound. 
Euclid's Fifth Postulate 
The axioms in Euclid's list do seem intuitively obvious, and the Elements it- 
self is proof that they can, as a group, be used to prove a wide variety of im- 
portant geometric facts. They also, with one exception, seem sufficiently 
basic to warrant axiom status—that is, they need not be proved by even more 
basic statements or assumptions. The one exception to this is the fifth pos- 
tulate. It is considerably more complicated to state than any of the others 
and does not seem quite as basic. 
Starting almost immediately after the publication of the Elements and 
continuing into the nineteenth century, mathematicians tried to demon- 
strate that Euclid's fifth postulate was unnecessary. That is, they at- 
tempted to upgrade the fifth postulate to a theorem by deducing it 
logically from the other nine. Many thought they had succeeded; invari- 
ably, however, some later mathematician would discover that in the course 
of his "proofs" he had unknowingly made some extra assumption, beyond 
the allowable set of postulates, that was in fact logically equivalent to the 
fifth postulate. 
In the early nineteenth century, after more than 2,000 years of trying 
to prove Euclid's fifth postulate, mathematicians began to entertain the idea 
that perhaps it was not provable after all and that Euclid had been correct 
to make it an axiom. Not long after that, several mathematicians, working 
independently, realized that if the fifth postulate did not follow from the 
others, it should be possible to construct a logically consistent geometric 
system without it. 
One of the many statements that were discovered to be equivalent to 
the fifth postulate (in the course of the many failed attempts to prove it) is 
"Given a straight line, and a point P not on that line, there exists at most 
one straight line passing through P that is parallel to the given line." The 
first "non-Euclidean" geometers took as axioms all the other nine postulates 
of Euclidean geometry but replaced the fifth postulate with the statement 
"There exists a straight line, and a point P not on that line, such that there 
are two straight lines passing through P that are parallel to the given line." 
That is, they replaced the fifth postulate with its negation and started ex- 
ploring the geometric system that resulted. 
Although this negated fifth postulate seems intuitively absurd, all our 
objections to it hinge on our pre-conceived notions of the meanings of the 
undefined terms "point" and "straight line." It has been proved that there 
is no logical incompatibility between the negated fifth postulate and the 
Euler, Leonhard 
other postulates of Euclidean geometry; thus, non-Euclidean geometry is as 
logically consistent as Euclidean geometry. 
The recognition of this fact—that there could be a mathematical sys- 
tem that seems to contradict our most fundamental intuitions of how 
geometric objects behave—led to great upheaval not only among mathe- 
maticians but also among scientists and philosophers, and led to a thorough 
and painstaking reconsideration of what was meant by words such as "prove," 
"know," and above all, "truth." see also Postulates; Theorems and 
Proofs; Proof.

Swiss Geometer and Number Theorist 
1707-1783 
Leonhard Euler is a name well known in many academic fields: philosophy, 
hydrodynamics, astronomy, optics, and physics. His true fame comes, how- 
ever, through his prolific work in pure mathematics. He produced more 
scholarly work in mathematics than have most other mathematicians. His 
abilities were so great that his contemporaries called him "Analysis Incar- 
nate." 
Euler (pronounced "oiler") was born in Switzerland in 1707. He had 
originally intended to follow the career path of his father, who was a Calvin- 
ist clergyman. Euler studied theology and Hebrew at the University of Basel. 
Johann Bernoulli, however, tutored Euler in mathematics on the side. 
Euler's facility in the subject was so great that his father, an amateur math- 
ematician himself, soon favored the decision of his son to pursue mathe- 
matics rather than join the clergy. 
Euler first taught at the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
in 1727. He married and eventually became the father of thirteen children. 
His children provided him with great joy, and children were often playing 
in the room or sitting on his lap while Euler worked. It was in Russia that 
he lost sight in one eye after working for three days to solve a mathemat- 
ics problem that Academy members urgently needed but had predicted 
would take months to solve. 
Euler was a very productive writer, completing five hundred books and 
papers in his lifetime and having four hundred more published posthu- 
mously. The Swiss edition of his complete works is contained in seventy- 
four volumes. He wrote Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum in 1748. This book 
introduces much of the material that is found in modern algebra and 
trigonometry textbooks. 
Exponential Growth and Decay 
Euler wrote the first treatment of differential calculus in 1755 in In- 
stitutiones Calculi Differentialis and in 1770 explored determinate and inde- 
terminate algebra in AnleitungzurAlgebra. Three-dimensional surfaces and 
conic sections were also extensively treated in his writings. 
Euler introduced many of the important mathematical symbols that are 
now in standard usage, such as X (for summation), 77 (the ratio of the cir- 
cumference of a circle to its diameter), f{x) (function notation), e (the base 
of a natural logarithm), and / (square root of negative one). He was the first 
to develop the calculus of variations. One of the more notable equations 
that he developed was cos0 + isinO = ???, which shows that exponential and 
trigonometric functions are related. Another important equation he devel- 
oped establishes a relationship among five of the most significant numbers, 
e™ +1=0. 
All of Euler's work was not strictly academic, however. He enjoyed solv- 
ing practical problems such as the famous "seven bridges of Konigsberg" 
problem that led to Euler circuits and paths. He even performed calcula- 
tions simply for their own sake. 
Euler later went to Berlin to become the director of Mathematics at 
the Academy of Science under Frederick the Great and to enjoy a more 
free political climate. However, Euler was viewed as being rather unso- 
phisticated, and Frederick referred to him as a "mathematical Cyclops." He 
returned to Russia when a more liberal leader, Catherine the Great, came 
to rule. 
By 1766, Euler was completely blind but continued to dictate his work 
to his secretary and his children. His last words, uttered as he suffered a fa- 
tal stroke in 1783, imitated his work in eloquence and simplicity: "I die."

Exponential Growth and Decay 
An exponential function is a function that has a variable as an exponent 
and the base is positive and not equal to one. For example, f(x) = I? is an 
exponential function. Note that fix) = xr is not an exponential function (but 
instead a basic polynomial function), because the exponent is a constant 
and not a variable. Exponential functions have graphs that are continuous 
curves and approach but never cross a horizontal asymptote. Many real-

Exponential Change 
Exponential growth is a mathematical change that increases without limit 
based on an exponential function. The change can be in the positive or neg- 
ative direction. The important concept is that the rate of change continues 
to increase. Exponential decay is found in mathematical functions where the 
rate of change is decreasing and thus must reach a limit, which is the hor- 
izontal asymptote of an exponential function. In the figure above, the as- 
ymptote is the x-axis where the rate of change approaches zero. Exponential 
decay may also be either decreasing or increasing; the important concept is 
that it progresses at a slower and slower rate. 
Exponential growth and decay are modeled in many real-world 
processes. Populations of growing microbes, and indeed a growing popu- 
lation of any life when not constrained by environmental factors such as 
available space and nutrition, can be modeled as a function showing ex- 
ponential growth. The growth of a savings account collecting compound 
interest is another example of an exponential growth function. 
Exponential Growth and Decay 
Exponential decay is seen in many processes as well. The decrease in 
radioactive material as it undergoes fission and decays into other atoms fits 
a curve of exponential decay. The discharge of an electric capacitor through 
a resistance can be calculated using exponential decay. A warm object as it 
cools to a constant surrounding temperature, or a cool object as it warms, 
will exhibit a curve showing exponential decay. 
A Sample Problem 
The following is an example of how the mathematics of exponential growth 
and decay can be used to solve problems. Suppose that a radioactive sam- 
ple, measured after 2 days, had only 60 percent as much of the sample as it 
had initially. How much of the sample could be expected to remain after 5 
days? 
To solve this problem, it must be understood that the sample is reduc- 
ing in size by exponential decay and the rate at which it is reducing must 
first be determined. Formulas for this exponential decay are as follows: 
N = Noekt and lnf —-J = kt 
where No is the original value, N is the new value, k is decay constant or 
rate of change, and t is time. Using the second formula we see that No is 
100 and Nis 60, and t (in days) is 2, we get ln(y0-^) = k2 which is —0.5108 
= k2 or -0.2554 = k. So the decay rate is -0.2554. Now that we know the 
decay rate, to find out what happens in 5 days we use the first formula N = 
Noekt where N = 100?5(-°-2554) and so N = 27.89. Thus we will have 27.89 
percent of the sample after 5 days, see also Logarithms; Powers and Ex- 
ponents.

Factorial 
The pattern of multiplying a positive integer by the next lower consecutive 
integer occurs frequently in mathematics. Look for the pattern in the fol- 
lowing expressions. 
7X6X5X4X3X2X1 
4X3X2X1 
(n + 5) X (n + 4) X (n + 3) X (n + 2) X (n + 1) X n 
The mathematical symbol for this string of factors is the familiar ex- 
clamation point (!). This pattern of multiplied whole numbers is called n 
factorial and is written as 72! So, starting with the greatest factor, 72, the fac- 
torial pattern is as follows: 
nl = n(n - \){n - 2)(n - 3). . . A). 
So, 
3! is 3 X 2 X 1 = 6 
5! is 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 120 
and 
1! = 1. 
Zero factorial @!) is arbitrarily defined to be 1. 
Most scientific calculators have a key (such as xl) that can be used to 
find factorial values. As n becomes larger, the value of its factorials increases 
rapidly. For example, 13! is 6,227,020,800. 
How Factorials Are Used 
Many mathematical formulas use factorial notation, including the formulas 
for finding permutations and combinations. For example, the number of 
permutations of n elements taken n at a time is 72!, and the number of per- 
mutations of n elements taken r at a time is equal to , ^' .,. 
There is also a problem that involves prime and composite numbers 
which uses a formula containing factorial notation. Mathematicians have, 
for many years, puzzled over the question of how prime numbers were dis- 
tributed. Notice that, in the whole numbers less than 20, there are eight

whole number, its nega- 
tive counterpart, or zero

Factors 
prime numbers B, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19). But from 20 to 40, there are 
only four prime numbers B3, 29, 31, and 37). 
No one has yet found a formula that will generate all the prime num- 
bers. However, the following sequence will give a string of n consecutive 
composite numbers (numbers that are not prime) for any positive integer n. 
(n + 1)! + 2, G7 + 1)! + 3, (n + 1)! + 4, G7 + 1)! + 5, (n + 1)! + 6, 
and so on up to (n + 1)! + (n + 1). 
When /7 is 2, notice that this sequence only has two terms: 
(n + 1)! + 2, (n + 1)! + G7 + 1) 
which is 
B + I)! + 2, B + 1)! + B + 1) 
For the first term, B + 1)! + 2 is 3! + 2 or C X 2 X 1) + 2, giving a value 
of 8. The second term has a value of 9. 
When 77 = 2, this sequence gives two consecutive numbers that are not 
prime numbers: 8, 9. When 77 = 3, this sequence gives three consecutive 
numbers that are not prime numbers: 26, 27, 28. This relationship between 
the value of n and the number of consecutive numbers that are not prime 
numbers continues in this sequence for any whole number value for n. For 
a greater 77, such as 300, a sequence of 300 composite numbers (that is, a 
list of 300 consecutive numbers with no prime number in the list) can be 
found, see also Factors; Primes, Puzzles of; Permutations and Com- 
binations.

Factors

tive counterpart, or zero 
prime number a 
number that has no fac- 
tors other than itself 
and 1 
Factors can be thought of as the multiplying building blocks for integers. A 
factor is an integer that divides another integer without leaving a remain- 
der. In general, an integer x is a factor of the integer ? if ^ is also an inte- 
ger. 
Because 8 divides 24 evenly (as 3), with no remainder, 8 is a factor of 
24. Eight factors into 2X2X2. Hence, the integer 24 is made up of the 
factors 2, 2, 2, and 3 multiplied together. 
Every integer is a factor of itself, because it divides itself evenly, with no 
remainder. Also, 1 is a factor of every number. All integers therefore have 
factors, because each integer (except 0) has at least two factors—1 and itself. 
When an integer has only two factors, then it is a prime number. Be- 
cause the only factors of 5 are 1 and 5, 5 is a prime number. When a num- 
ber has more than two factors, then it is a composite number. Besides 1 and 
15, 15 has two more factors—3 and 5; hence, 15 is a composite number. 
All even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8,. . . have 2 as a factor. By definition, an even 
number is a multiple of 2 and can be written as In, where n is a positive in- 
teger. Odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7,. . . are of the form 2/2 + 1. Therefore, by 
definition, 2 cannot be a factor of an odd number. 
Fermat, Pierre de 
A factor that is a prime number is called a prime factor. For instance, 
3 and 5 are prime factors of 15, and 3X5 = 15. The "fundamental theo- 
rem of arithmetic" states that every integer can be expressed as a unique 
product of prime factors. In other words, every whole number can be ex- 
pressed as a product of primes (and 1) unique to it. For example, the prime 
factors of 20 are 2,2, and 5, since 2X2X5 = 2 0, and no other set of 
prime factors will yield the number 20. 
The Greatest Common Factor 
What is the greatest common factor of 16 and 8? This question asks which 
factors 16 and 8 have in common and which of those factors is the great- 
est. For instance, 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 16. Eight is also a 
common factor of 8 and 16. But 8 is the greatest common factor of 8 and 
16. As the name suggests, the greatest common factor of two or more num- 
bers is the largest factor shared by them. What is the greatest common fac- 
tor of 12, 8, and 4? It is 4 because 4 is the largest number that divides all 
three numbers, see also Primes, Puzzles of.

Fermat, Pierre de 
Ftench Lawyer and Mathematician 
1601-1665 
Pierre de Fermat was born in 1601 in Beaumont-de-Lomagne, France, and 
died in 1665 in Castres, France. He was the founder of modern number 
theory, one of the initiators of analytic geometry, and co-founder of prob- 
ability theory. He also invented important mathematical methods that an- 
ticipated differential and integral calculus. 
Little is known of Fermat's early life. He received his law degree from 
the University of Orleans and served as councilor to parliament beginning 
in 1634. His real passion, however, was mathematics. Throughout his life 
he attacked difficult problems, many times with remarkable success. Un- 
fortunately, he did not publish his results, which were known only through 
correspondence. Had Fermat published, his contributions would have been 
more influential during his lifetime. 
Fermat applied the methods of algebra to geometry using a coordinate 
system in his study of loci. Descartes's equivalent approach earned him, not 
Fermat, credit for founding analytic geometry because Fermat's work was 
not published until after his death. 
Blaise Pascal contacted Fermat in 1654, and through the ensuing cor- 
respondence in which they tried to mathematically predict the numbers that 
dice would show in gambling, they co-founded probability theory. In de- 
veloping a method of finding tangents to curves and determining the area 
Pierre de Fermat's dis- 
agreements with 
Descartes over principles 
of analytic geometry hurt 
Fermat's reputation as a 
mathematician, but it was 
Descartes who admitted 
in the end that Fermat's 
methods were correct. 
Fermat's Last Theorem

number that has no fac- 
tors other than itself

integral numbers inte- 
gers, that is, positive 
whole numbers, their 
negative counterparts, 
or zero 
bounded by curves, Fermat laid the groundwork for both differential cal- 
culus and integral calculus. 
Fermat developed numerous theorems involving prime numbers and 
integral numbers and, consequently, is regarded as the founder of modern 
number theory. The best known of these theorems, Fermat's Last Theo- 
rem, was not proved until 1994. see also Fermat's Last Theorem; Prob- 
ability, Theoretical.

Fermat's Last Theorem 
Andrew Wiles worked 
secretly and mostly alone 
to solve Fermat's Last 
Theorem. Despite his 
proof offered in 1994, no 
one has yet found the 
proof that Pierre de 
Fermat claimed to pos- 
sess because no one has 
found a proof that used 
the mathematics and 
mathematical tools avail- 
able to Fermat in the sev- 
enteenth century. 
The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem involves two people separated by over 
350 years. The first is the French lawyer and mathematician Pierre de Fer- 
mat, who, in about 1637, left a note written in the margin of a book. His 
note said that the equation a'1 + bn = cn has no solutions when a, b, and ? 
are whole numbers and n is a whole number greater than 2. The note went 
on to say that he had marvelous proof of this statement, but the book mar- 
gin was too narrow for him to write out his proof. 
In the twentieth century, a 10-year-old British boy named Andrew Wiles 
read about this problem and was intrigued and challenged by it. No won- 
der: Fermat's Last Theorem has been called the world's greatest and hard- 
est mathematical problem. Wiles's childhood dream became "to solve it 
myself. . . such a challenge . . . such a beautiful problem." 
The Challenge 
Before finding out how Wiles proved Fermat' Last Theorem, consider the 
equation a11 + bn = cn. Working with the Pythagorean theorem and right 
triangles reveals that, in every right triangle, a2 + b2 = c2. There are also 
certain whole number values for a, b, and ? that are called Pythagorean triples, 
such as 3, 4, and 5; 5, 12, and 13; 27, 36, and 45; or 9, 40, and 41. Many 
such triples can be found, and there are formulas that can be used to grind 
them out endlessly. 
Notice, however, that the exponent (n) for these Pythagorean triples is 
2. Fermat's Last Theorem says that such triples cannot be found for any 
whole number greater than 2. By the 1980s, mathematicians using com- 
puters had proven that Fermat's Last Theorem was correct for all the whole 
number values of n less than 600, but that is not the same as a general proof 
that the statement must always be true. Fermat's statement—that the equa- 
tion an + bn = c11 has no solutions when a, b, and ? are whole numbers and 
n is a whole number greater than 2—may be fairly simple to state, but it 
has not been so simple to prove. 
The Solution 
After 7 years of working on the problem in complete secrecy, Andrew Wiles 
used modern mathematics and modern methods to prove Fermat's Last The- 
Fibonacci, Leonardo Pisano 
orem. The modern mathematics and methods he used did not, in general, 
entail making long and elaborate calculations with the aid of computers. In- 
stead, Wiles, while a researcher at Princeton, used modern number theory 
and thousands of hours of writing by hand on a chalkboard as he thought, 
tried, and failed, and thought some more about how to prove Fermat's Last 
Theorem. 
As Wiles worked on finding a proof, he looked for patterns; he tried to 
fit in his ideas with previous broad conceptual ideas of mathematics; he mod- 
ified existing work; he looked for new strategies. He used the work of many 
mathematicians, reading their papers to see if they contained ideas or meth- 
ods he could use. It cook him 3 years to accomplish the first step. In spring 
of 1993, he felt that he was nearly there, and in May of 1993, he believed 
he had solved the problem. 
Wiles asked a friend to review his work, and, in September of 1993, a 
fundamental error was found in his proof. He worked until the end of No- 
vember 1993 trying to correct this error, but finally he announced that there 
was a problem with part of the argument in the proof. Wiles worked almost 
another whole year trying to correct this flaw. After months of failure while 
working alone, he was close to admitting defeat. He finally asked for help 
from a former student, and together they worked for 6 months to review 
all the steps in the proof without finding a way to correct the flaw. 
In September of 1994, a year after the error was originally found, Wiles 
went back one more time to look at what was not working. On Monday 
morning, September 19, 1994, Andrew Wiles saw how to correct the error 
and complete his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. He called the insight 
that completed this proof "indescribably beautiful—so simple and elegant." 
The solution of Fermat's Last Theorem involves the very advanced 
mathematical concepts of elliptic curves and modular forms. Wiles's subse- 
quent paper on the proof, "Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat's Last The- 
orem," was published in 1995 in the Annals of Mathematics, see also

associated with the devel-

bonacci sequence in his honor. The Fibonacci sequence evolved from the 
following problem in Fibonacci's book Liber abbaci. 
A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded by a wall. 
How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a 
year if it is supposed that every month each pair begets a new pair 
which from the second month on becomes productive? 
The answer is F12 = 377. 
It is worth noting that Fibonacci did not name the Fibonacci sequence; 
the sequence was given the name by the nineteenth-century French math- 
ematician, Edouard Lucas. Lucas also found many important applications 
of the Fibonacci sequence.5^ 
Fibonacci made many other contributions to mathematics. He is cred- 
ited with introducing the Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe. This is the po- 
sitional number system based on the ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 
a decimal point. 
In Liber quadratorum ("The Book of Squares"), Fibonacci described a 
method to construct Pythagorean triples. If he wanted to find two 
squares whose sum was a square, he took any odd square as one of the 
two squares. He then found the other square by adding all the odd num- 
bers from 1 up to but not including the odd square. For example, if he 
took 9 as one of the two squares, the other square is obtained by adding 
all the odd numbers up to 9—that is, 1, 3, 5, and 7, whose sum is 16, a 
square. And 9 + 16 = 25, another square. Also, in this book Fibonacci 
proved that there are no positive integers m and n, such that m2 + n2 and 
m2 — n2 are both squares.

Field Properties 
David Hilbert, a famous German mathematician A862-1943), called math- 
ematics the rules of a game played with meaningless marks on paper. In 
defining the rules of the game called mathematics, mathematicians have or- 
ganized numbers into various sets, or structures, in which all the numbers 
satisfy a particular group of rules. Mathematicians call any set of numbers 
that satisfies the following properties a field: closure, commutativity, asso- 
ciativity, distributivity, identity elements, and inverses. 
Field Properties 
Determining a Field 
Consider the set of non-negative even numbers: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,. . .}. 
To determine whether this set is a field, test to see if it satisfies each of the 
six field properties. 
Closure. When any two numbers from this set are added, is the result al- 
ways a number from this set? Yes, adding two non-negative even numbers 
will always result in a non-negative even number. The set of non-negative 
even numbers is therefore closed under addition. 
Is the set of even non-negative numbers also closed under multiplica- 
tion? Yes, multiplying two non-negative even numbers will also always re- 
sult in a non-negative even number. The closure property applies to the set 
of non-negative even numbers under the two operations of addition and 
multiplication. 
Commutativity. Notice also that, with any two numbers from this set {a, 
b\ a + b = b + a and ab = ba. Therefore, the commutative property for ad- 
dition and for multiplication applies also. 
Associativity. It is also true that (a + b) + ? = a + (b + c) and (ab)c = 
a(bc). The associative property for addition and for multiplication thus applies for 
the set of non-negative even numbers. 
Distributivity. If the distributive property applies to the set of non-negative 
even numbers, a(b + c) = ab + ac. Since this is true for any non-negative 
even numbers, the set does satisfy this property. 
Identity Elements. Within this set of non-negative even numbers, is there 
an identity element for addition? That is, is there a number n such that 
adding that number leaves a non-negative even number unchanged in value? 
Does the set contain an n such that a + n = ai Yes, n can be 0, so 0 is the 
identity element for addition in this set. 
Is there a corresponding identity element for multiplication in this set? 
No. Here the set of non-negative even numbers fails the test. There is no 
number p in this set such that ap = a. The number p could be 1 because 1 
is an identity element for multiplication, but 1 is not in the set of non- 
negative even numbers. 
Because the identity property is not satisfied by the set of non-negative 
even numbers, the set does not form a field. 
Inverses. The set of non-negative even numbers also does not satisfy the 
sixth property for a field. This set does not contain additive and multi- 
plicative inverses for each number in the set. An additive inverse for 2 might 
be —2, since 2 + (—2) = 0, but —2 is not in this set. A multiplicative in- 
verse for 2 might be y, since 2 (y) = 1, but ? is also not in this set. 
Numbers Sets that Are Fields 
Are there sets of numbers that are fields—that is, that satisfy all six of the 
field properties—closure, commutativity, associativity, distributivity, iden- 
tity elements, and inverses? If the set of non-negative even integers is ex- 
panded to include the negative integers (to supply the additive inverses), all 
the integers (so that 1 is the multiplicative identity), and all the rational 
numbers (such as y, to supply all the multiplicative inverses, or reciprocals), 
then the result is the set of all rational numbers. 
rational numbers num- 
bers that can be written 
as the ratio of two inte- 
gers in the form a/b 
where a and b are inte- 
gers and b is not zero 
Financial Planner 
The set of rational numbers is a field because it satisfies all six proper- 
ties. This set is closed because adding or multiplying any two rational num- 
bers results in a rational number. It is commutative, associative, and 
distributive. It contains an additive identity, 0, and a multiplicative identity, 
1. Every number in the set (except 0) has an additive inverse and a multi- 
plicative inverse in the set. 
Notice that the rules for a field do not require that 0 have a reciprocal; 
division by 0 is undefined. 
Another set of numbers that form a field, because they satisfy all six of 
the field properties, is the set of all numbers on the real number line. This 
set of all real numbers is formed by joining the rational numbers to all the 
irrational numbers. Recall that an irrational number cannot be expressed as 
the ratio of two integers. 
A third set of numbers that forms a field is the set of complex numbers. 
Complex numbers are all the numbers that can be written in the form a + 
bi where a and b are real numbers, and / is the square root of — 1. 
There are other sets of numbers that form a field. For example, con- 
sider this set of numbers: {0, 1, 2, 3}. The operation of addition is defined 
in the following way. Add the two numbers in the set and, if the result is 4 
or more, subtract the number 4 until a number, called the sum, remains that 
is in the set. This method of arithmetic is called modular arithmetic (in this 
case, mod 4). 
Thus, 2 + 3, for example, yields 1 (since 5—4=1); and 1 + 3 yields 
0 (since 4 — 4 = 0). When addition is defined in this way (in this case, as 
mod 4), then this set is closed under addition. The identity element for ad- 
dition is 4 because, for example, 2+4 yields 2, so that adding 4 leaves a 
number from this set unchanged. 
Notice that each number in the set (other than 0) does have a multi- 
plicative inverse, since, using mod 4 arithmetic, 1X1 = 1, and 2X3=2, 
and 3X1 = 3. The set is also closed under multiplication, using mod 4 
arithmetic. It also shows associativity, commutativity, and distributivity un- 
der these definitions of addition and multiplication. There are many other 
finite sets that are finite fields when this kind of modular arithmetic is used.

Financial Planner 
Financial planners help individuals and businesses invest money. They pro- 
vide financial advice based on their knowledge of tax and investment strate- 
gies, stocks and bonds, insurance, retirement plans, and real estate. 
Financial planners interview their clients to help them define their fi- 
nancial needs and goals and to determine how much money clients have 
Flight, Measurements of 
available for investment. Whether the goal is long-term investing (for ex- 
ample, retirement) or short-term investing, financial planners use informa- 
tion provided by a client to develop a financial plan tailored to the client's 
needs. Additionally, a financial planner often sells stocks, bonds, mutual 
funds, and insurance. 
Financial planners can work for credit unions, credit counseling com- 
panies, banks, and companies that specialize in offering financial advice. The 
vast majority of financial planners have bachelor's or master's degrees. A 
college degree in business administration or finance is useful. 
Financial planners often use mathematics on the job. They calculate 
which proportion of a client's money may go into a particular investment. 
For example, does the client want half of his money to be invested in stocks 
and half in real estate? 
Financial planners review stocks and bonds to determine which have the 
best profits. For example, a stock that is bought for $10 a share and becomes 
worth $15 a share shows a 50 percent return on the investment. They must 
calculate how much a purchase of multiple shares of a stock will cost. Four 
shares at $20 per share will cost $80. 
For long-term investments, a financial planner may need to calculate 
compound interest. He or she must project and add all the investments over 
time to assess if enough money will be available for the client's retirement.

Flight, Measurements of 
Piloting an aircraft requires constant scanning and verifying of measure- 
ments. Pilots develop a sense of reasonable measurements for routine situ- 
ations. For non-routine situations, pilots practice in simulators so they can 
quickly make sense of the measurements they see on the aircraft's instru- 
ment panel. When necessary, they can make rapid decisions to correct for 
unanticipated conditions. The U.S. customary system of measurement is 
used, because that is the system used by most pilots in the United States 
and worldwide. 
Level Flight 
On an aircraft, a propeller or jet engine provides thrust, which moves the 
plane forward through the air. Thrust acts parallel to the direction of flight. 
The weight of the aircraft is the force of gravity acting toward the center 
of Earth. The aerodynamic forces of lift and drag result from air pressure. 
Lift, the vertical component, acts to oppose gravity. Drag acts opposite to 
the flight path of the aircraft. 
Financial planners often 
discuss investment 
strategies with clients 
over the telephone. Their 
pay, or commission, is 
often a percentage of the 
dollar amount of the 
financial product sold. 
MATHEMATICS AND 
FLYING 
High school students who plan 
to attend a college with a 
strong flight program should 
complete 4 years of high school 
mathematics, including 
trigonometry and pre-calculus. 
Some students will have taken 
calculus in high school, but stu- 
dents may take calculus in their 
first year of college. Good 
grades in trigonometry and pre- 
calculus, in which vectors are 
studied, meet the prerequisites 
for enrolling in aerodynamics 
and simultaneously beginning 
flight training. Soon after begin- 
ning, first-year college students 
in aviation programs become 
accustomed to the many mea- 
surements critical to flying and 
to using mathematics to make 
sense of the measurements. 
Flight, Measurements of 
Thrust _^ I I ^Jr—^_ 1 1 Dra6 
An aircraft in level flight must be in a condition of equilibrium, mean- 
ing the forces (vector quantities) acting upon the aircraft (thrust, drag, 
weight, and lift) are in balance. To be in balance, lift must equal weight and 
engine thrust (power) must equal drag. 
During flight, pilots continuously scan the cockpit instrument panel. 
They pay particular attention to the instruments that display measurements 
of altitude, speed, attitude, and direction. 
Altitude 
Pilots are concerned with three types of altitude: true-altitude, pressure- 
altitude, and absolute-altitude. They read true-altitude (height above mean 
sea level) and pressure-altitude (height above a standard reference plane) 
from a pressure-altimeter, which is an instrument dependent upon air pres- 
sure. A pilot uses a radar-altimeter to read absolute altitude, which is the 
height above the terrain directly below the aircraft. 
Prior to takeoff, pilots set local barometric pressure into the pressure- 
altimeter to monitor true-altitude during takeoff and climb. For flight be- 
low 18,000 feet, pilots continue to monitor true-altitude. Every 100 miles, 
they obtain local pressure from air controllers on the ground and update 
their altimeter. For flight above 18,000 feet pilots reset their altimeter to 
the standard pressure of 29.92 inches of mercury and monitor pressure-al- 
titude. Consistent use of standard air-pressure at high altitudes by all air- 
craft permits maintenance of necessary vertical separation. 
Altimeter readings do not provide pilots with information about how 
high they are above terrain features. Instead, pilots monitor their position 
using a variety of electronic aids, including the global positioning system 
(GPS). Below 5,000 feet they can monitor their ground height using a radar 
altimeter. For example, if the altimeter reads 3,000 feet and the aircraft is 
over a 2,000-foot plateau, the pilot can "ping" Earth with a radar signal. 
The radar altimeter translates the return signal to an altitude above ground 
level of 1,000 feet. 
Airspeed 
knot nautical mile per The airspeed indicator converts airflow to an airspeed reading in knots. The 
hour airspeed indicator receives information about airflow from a device that is 
Flight, Measurements of 
mounted on the outside of the aircraft. Pilots or computers correct for the 
air density at altitude to determine true airspeed. As altitude increases, air 
density decreases. At 18,000 feet the air density is about one-half of sea- 
level density and creates considerably less impact on the aircraft. 
To determine true airspeed, pilots must make corrections for the air- 
speed indicator reading. If an airspeed indicator reads 100 knots in an air- 
craft that is traveling at an altitude of 5,000 feet with outside air temperature 
of 10 degrees Celsius, a pilot can consult a conversion chart that shows the 
indicated airspeed should be multiplied by 1.09 to obtain true airspeed. In 
this example, the computed true airspeed would be 109 knots using the con- 
version chart, or 110 knots using a rule of thumb. For quick mental esti- 
mations, pilots use a rule of thumb in which they add 2 percent of indicated 
airspeed for each 1,000 feet of altitude to get true airspeed. Pilots can com- 
pute groundspeed, critical for determining flight time and fuel needs, by 
adding tailwind or subtracting headwind from true airspeed. 
Attitude 
Attitude refers to the position of an aircraft with reference to the horizon. 
Attitude measurements of pitch, roll, and yaw are measured on a right hand, 
three-dimensional axis system, with the origin representing the center of 
gravity for the aircraft. Attitude is measured in degrees from level flight. 
tailwind a wind blowing 
in the same direction as 
that of the course of a 
vehicle 
headwind a wind blow- 
ing in the opposite 
direction as that of the 
course of a vehicle 
An attitude indicator on the control panel provides pitch and roll in- 
formation by displaying a symbol that represents aircraft wings on a "move- 
able horizon." The moveable horizon is an equator-like horizontal line 
drawn on the sphere in the horizon indicator. The sphere is attached to a 
spinning gyroscope, which remains in a vertical position relative to Earth. 
The hemispherical region above the horizon line represents the sky, and be- 
low represents the ground. A symbol of an aircraft is drawn on the clear cir- 
cular case over the sphere. When the aircraft changes attitude, the aircraft 
symbol changes position relative to the horizon on the sphere. Pilots can 
determine the amount of pitch or roll by comparing the position of the wing 
of the aircraft symbol with the horizon line. 
Pitch is rotation about the y-axis or lateral axis. A nose-up aircraft po- 
sition results in positive degrees of pitch. To determine the pitch of the air- 
craft, pilots consult the position of the aircraft symbol with respect to the 
gyroscope a device typ- 
ically consisting of a 
spinning wheel or disk, 
whose spin-axis turns 
between two low-friction 
supports; it maintains 
its angular orientation 
with respect to inertial 
conditions when not 
subjected to external 
forces 
Flight, Measurements of 
SCALARS AND VECTORS 
Scalar and vector are two types 
of measurements important to 
the study of flight. Scalar quan- 
tities have size or magnitude 
only, whereas vector quantities 
consist of magnitude and direc- 
tion. For example, if an aircraft 
travels 100 miles, the distance 
is a scalar. If an aircraft travels 
100 miles to the east, the dis- 
placement is a vector. 
horizon line on the attitude indicator. When an aircraft is climbing, the 
wings of the symbol in the display are positioned above the horizon line. A 
nose-down aircraft position results in negative degrees of pitch. 
Roll is rotation about the positive x-axis or longitudinal axis. If a pilot 
causes the left wing to roll downward 30 degrees about the longitudinal axis, 
the aircraft is said to be in a 30 degree left bank. 
Direction 
Yaw is the term for rotation about the vertical or %-axis. An aircraft is said 
to yaw when it changes direction. Pilots fly a magnetic heading that they 
read from the heading indicator. This tool consists of a flat circular card 
that is mounted underneath a clear cover with an aircraft drawn on it. The 
circular card is marked with 360 degrees similar to a circular protractor, 
with 0 degrees representing north. 
The heading indicator illustrated above shows the aircraft's heading in 
degrees from magnetic North. Here the aircraft is headed due North. Note 
that each number must be multiplied by 10 to yield the actual degree read- 
ing. 
As an aircraft (and the aircraft symbol) turns and rotates, a gyroscope 
attached to the circular card keeps the card stabilized and fixed in space. 
The nose of the aircraft symbol continually points in the direction the air- 
craft is heading. 
A gyroscope does not "know" the direction of magnetic north: there- 
fore, pilots initially read a magnetic heading from a magnetic compass and 
set the heading indicator. Gyroscopic drift causes heading indicators to be- 
come inaccurate during flight. Therefore, heading indicators must be peri- 
odically corrected with information from a magnetic compass. 
Take-off 
During take-off, engine thrust accelerates the aircraft to the critical veloc- 
ity necessary for lift to overcome drag, rolling friction, and the weight of 
the plane. Pilots continually monitor airspeed during take-off, aware that 
once the aircraft exceeds what is termed "refusal speed" there is no longer 
enough runway to stop the aircraft and the pilot is committed to take-off. 
Gross weight of an aircraft is a critical factor in take-off. Runway dis- 
tance required for take-off varies with the square of the gross weight of the 
Flight, Measurements of 
aircraft. For example, consider a Boeing 707 taking off at sea level at stan- 
dard temperature and barometric pressure. If the aircraft weighs 172,500 
pounds without cargo or passengers, it requires a take-off speed of 112 knots 
and 1,944 feet of runway distance to take-off. If the aircraft were loaded 
with 100,000 pounds of cargo and passengers, the aircraft would then weigh 
272,500 pounds, require a 156 knot take-off speed, and 5,500 feet of run- 
way to take-off. The 58 percent increase in weight required a 39 percent 
increase in take-off speed and a 183 percent increase in take-off distance. 
At take-off, the pilot guides the aircraft to the intended altitude. To 
maintain a steady velocity climb, forces must be in equilibrium. During the 
climb, the weight vector (W) is resolved into a vector perpendicular to the 
flight path (Wcos7) and a vector parallel to the flight path (Wsin7), where 
7 is the climb angle, and cos and sin are two trigonometric functions. 
velocity distance trav- 
eled per unit of time in 
a specific direction 
To balance the forces along the flight path, the thrust force must equal 
the drag force plus Wsin7. A reasonable climb angle for a Boeing 707 
aircraft is 6 degrees. A take-off weight of 172,500 pounds and a 6-degree 
angle of climb requires approximately 78,100 pounds of jet engine thrust. 
The four engines on a Boeing 707 each can supply 22,000 pounds of thrust. 
The take-off angle is the result of optimizing the pounds of fuel needed for 
climb and the time and ground distance traveled before the aircraft reaches 
its desired flight altitude. During take-off the pilot monitors the vertical ve- 
locity indicator to assure that the aircraft maintains the climb angle. As- 
cending at 4,325 feet per minute results in an approximate climb angle of 6 
degrees. 
Landing 
When pilots travel, Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) air traffic controllers 
monitor their flight. Pilots fly between points on airways, which can be 
thought of as highways in the sky. When an aircraft comes within a speci- 
fied radius of the airport at which the pilot plans to land, FAA controllers 
pass the aircraft to an approach controller. Approach controllers "vector the 
aircraft" for approach and landing. This means they give pilots an airspeed 
and direction to fly toward the glide slope. The glide slope is an angle, with 
direction, on which the aircraft descends for its landing. It is generally about 
3 degrees. 
Form and Value 
In a ground directed approach, approach controllers direct pilots with 
heading corrections and rates of descent in feet per minute so the aircraft 
will stay on the glide slope. In an instrument landing approach, pilots mon- 
itor direction, attitude, and vertical-velocity indicators to maintain the air- 
craft on the glide slope until touch down, see also Angles, Measurement 
of; Global Positioning System; Magnetic and Geographic Poles; Nav- 
igation; Vectors.

Form and Value 
Two mathematical expressions may take different form and yet have the 
same value. For example, V4 and 2 look different but are the same num- 
ber. Likewise, the number 1 can be expressed as 3° or y. 
In the decimal system, for example, the fraction ? is also expressed as 
0.5. The word "fraction" refers to the form of a number. The form of ? is 
a fraction, but its value is 4, which is an integer. Similarly, 2 ? has the form 
of a mixed fraction, but it can be expressed as the fraction y, or the decimal 
number 2.5. 
Algebraic expressions also have form and value. The value of 3(r + 2) 
and 3x + 6 is the same, but 3(r + 2) is in the monomial form, and 3x + 
6 is in the binomial form. Numbers can be also written using both mono- 
mial and binomial form. 
In monomial form, even numbers are expressed as 2x for x = 1, 2, 3,. . . 
generating all even numbers 2, 4, 6,. ... In binomial form, even numbers 
are expressed as 2x + 2 for x = 0, 1, 2,. . ., which again generates all the 
even numbers 2, 4, 6,. ...

Fractals 
The term "fractal" was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot to describe a "self- 
similar" geometrical object that looks much the same on many different 
scales of measurement. This property contrasts with the property of a cir- 
cle, for example, which loses its structure when viewed on a different scale 
and becomes almost a straight line when any arc is greatly magnified. 
Fractals 
Fractals are representations of objects with an infinite amount of de- 
tail. When magnified, fractals do not become simpler, but instead remain 
as complex as they were without magnification. This is why fractals seem 
to describe natural objects in a better way than simple geometric figures like 
triangles, rectangles, or circles. 
A coastline is a classical example of self-similarity in nature. From the 
air, a sea coast looks irregular by virtue of its bays and headlands. A closer 
look will reveal the same structure yet on a different scale. Each bay has its 
own bays and headlands. An even closer look will show even more bays and 
promontories within the larger bays. Even a beach will have small bays, 
capes, and peninsulas. On a much smaller scale in nature, a microscope will 
reveal a self-similar structure even within a grain of sand, which will have 
indentations and extrusions. 
Constructing Geometric Fractals 
Any mathematically created fractal can be made by the iteration, or repeti- 
tion, of a certain rule. There are three basic types of iteration: 
• generator iteration, which is repeatedly substituting certain geomet- 
ric shapes with other shapes; 
• IFS (Iterated Function System) iteration, which is repeatedly apply- 
ing geometric transformations (such as rotation and reflection) to 
points; and 
• formula iteration, which is repeating a certain mathematical formula 
or several formulas. 
The property of self-similarity holds true for the majority of mathematically 
created fractals. 
The figure below illustrates the geometric construction of the Koch 
Curve, named after Helge von Koch, a Swedish mathematician who intro- 
duced this curve in a 1904 paper. First, begin with a straight line, as shown 
in (a). This initial object can be called the initiator. Partition this into three 
equal parts, then replace the middle third by an equilateral triangle and 
take away its base, as shown in (b). These steps are repeated with each re- 
sulting segment, as shown in (c). The repetition of steps is known as itera- 
tion. The curve shown in (d) is the result after three iterations, and the curve 
in (e) is after four iterations. The actual Koch Curve cannot be shown be- 
cause it is theoretical, resulting from an infinite number of iterations.

Characteristics of Fractals 
When showing images of fractal figures, approximations given by a finite 
number of steps are displayed because these approximations—as in the case 
of the Koch Curve—will yield a curve with finite length. The actual fractal 
curve will have infinite length. 
Because actual fractal figures like the Koch Curve have infinite length, 
they have interesting properties uncommon in simpler geometric figures. 
For example, a fractal closed curve such as the Koch Snowflake can enclose 
a figure with infinite perimeter and finite area. Although not shown here, 
the Koch Snowflake is constructed from an equilateral triangle, using a Koch 
Curve to initiate each of its sides. The snowflake has an infinite perimeter 
because the geometric pattern in (d) of the previous unnumbered figure 
comprises the snowflake's outer border and can be repeated an infinite num- 
ber of times at increasingly smaller scales. 
Fractal Dimensions. Because of their complexity, fractal objects cannot 
be assigned a dimension as can a line or a square. For example, the Koch 
Curve cannot have dimension 1, as a line, nor can it have dimension 2, as 
a square. So there must be other ways of calculating its fractal dimension. 
The calculation of fractal dimensions is related to A) the number of 
pieces into which a structure can be divided and B) the reduction factor. 
The Koch Curve, in general, has 4^ pieces with a reduction factor of -jk. So 
Fractals 
when it has four pieces, the reduction factor is j, and when it has sixteen 
pieces the reduction factor is -g. Similarly, the Sierpinski Gasket, in general, 
has 3k pieces with a reduction factor ^. So with three pieces the reduction 
factor is y, and with nine pieces the reduction factor is ^. 
This idea was used in 1919 by the German mathematician Felix Haus- 
dorff to define a fractal dimension that agrees with the usual dimension on 
the usual spaces. Although it is too complicated to be presented here, it is 
interesting to know that the dimension of the Koch Curve is approximately 
1.2619 (or ]^~y) and the Sierpinski Gasket has a dimension close to 1.585 
(°r if})- 
For shapes that are not as regular as the Koch Curve or the Sierpinski 
Gasket, such as clouds or coastlines, this method of determining the fractal 
dimension does not work. Fractals that are not composed of a certain num- 
ber of identical versions of itself require other methods for determining the 
fractal dimension. 
Julia and Mandelbrot Sets 
Complex numbers are numbers of the form a + bi, where / = V—1. By 
representing the complex number a + bi with the point (a, b) in the Carte- 
sian plane, a graphical representation of the complex numbers known as 
the complex plane is obtained. Complex numbers can be added, multiplied, 
and divided, just as real numbers. However, it is important to bear in mind 
that i2 = — 1. So functions can be defined using complex numbers as input, 
and the output of these functions will be, in general, complex numbers. 
Gaston Julia A893-1978) investigated what happens when functions in 
the complex plane are iterated. Consider, for example, the function f(z) = 
z2 + c, where ? is a complex number. For real numbers, it is not difficult to 
evaluate this function. If ? = 1 + /', and one wants to evaluate the function 
for z = 2, then/B) = 22 + 1 + / = 4 + 1 + / = 5 + /'. Squaring complex 
numbers is just a little bit more difficult, but it is enough to realize that 
when a function like this takes a complex number as input, it yields another 
complex number as output. If this function is iterated (that is, if the output 
becomes the input), and the function is evaluated again and again, one of 
two things can happen. Either the output numbers will begin to grow and 
to go farther from the origin, or somehow they will stay close to the ori- 
gin, even if the function is iterated many times. 
For example, select ? = —0.125 + 0.75/, and evaluate/for z = 0. Eval- 
uating the function again using as the input the output of ??), and contin- 
uing this repetition of using each output value as the next input value yields 
a sequence of complex numbers different than the sequence of complex num- 
bers that would result from evaluating the same function with an initial value 
of z = —0.5 + 0.5/. The difference is that for the initial value z = 0, the 
resulting sequence of complex numbers remains bounded; that is, the se- 
quence remains close to the origin. On the other hand, the sequence given 
by z = —0.5 + 0.5/ quickly goes far away from the origin. 
The collection of complex numbers, represented as points on the com- 
plex plane, that lead to sequences that stay always close to the origin is called 
the prisoner set for c, whereas the collection of points that lead to unbounded 
sequences is called the escape set for ? The Julia Set is the boundary be- 
tween the two sets.

Fractals 
The elegance of the Mandelbrot Set (top left) becomes evident in three magnifications, starting at a very small portion of 
the set's border in the center of the first frame. Between the top right and lower left frames, the magnification increases by 
a factor of 5. The lower right frame is a much greater magnification of the edge of the spiral in the middle of the previous 
frame. Note the miniature Mandelbrot Set (in white) embedded in this final magnification. 
Although not shown here, the prisoner set for ? = —0.125 + 0.75/ and 
its bordering Julia Set is considered connected because it appears in one 
piece. On the other hand, the Julia Set for ? = —0.75 + 0.125/ is discon- 
nected because it consists of pieces that are separated from each other. If all 
those values ? in the complex plane that have connected Julia Sets are col- 
ored black, the result is known as the Mandelbrot Set, named in honor of 
Fractals 
Benoit Mandelbrot. It is not surprising that this set has a complexity that 
placed it beyond the reach of mathematicians until computers were used to 
study it. Mandelbrot studied Julia's work extensively and used computer 
graphics to render the Julia Sets and the Mandelbrot Set. 
Self-similarity in the Mandelbrot Set is of a different nature than in the 
Koch Curve and Sierpinski Gasket because it arises from iterations of qua- 
dratic functions rather than from generator iterations or IFS iterations, as 
described above. In the Mandelbrot Set, identical pictures cannot be seen 
right away. But as the four-frame image shows, under increasing magnifi- 
cations, the borders will reveal hidden complexities and even tiny copies of 
the Mandelbrot Set. 
Fractals in Science and Art 
Before Mandelbrot, none of the mathematical pioneers thought that their 
theoretical speculations about iterative processes and their relation to ex- 
tremely unusual sets would end up being the best tools to describe nature. 
And yet fractals have proven to be a rich subject of study. They have been 
used to describe nature and are used frequently by scientists of different dis- 
ciplines to explore very diverse phenomena. Fractal structures can be found 
in the leaves of a tree, in the course of a river, in the shape of a broccoli, in 
our arterial system, and on the surface of a virus. 
The earliest applications of fractals, and perhaps the most widely seen 
by nonscientists, occur in the arts and in the film industry, where fractal 
forgery has been used to create landscapes for science fiction movies. Us- 
ing fractals, convincing simulations of clouds, mountains, and surfaces of 
alien worlds have been created for our amusement. 
In the 1970s, a young scientist, Loren Carpenter, made a computer 
movie of a flight over a fractal landscape. This brought him to the atten- 
tion of Lucasfilm Ltd, whose graphic division, Pixar, immediately hired him. 
His work with fractals was used to create the geography of the moons of 
Endor and the outline of the Death Star in the movie Return of the Jedi. 
Fractals were also used to generate the landscape of the Genesis planet in 
the movie Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan. Carpenter has received awards for 
his contributions to the film industry, and his work in these two movies trig- 
gered the extended use of fractals for special effects and to simulate land- 
scapes and other irregular shapes in three-dimensional C-D) computer 
games. 
The study of fractals is still a young branch of mathematics, and more 
applications are yet to be revealed, see also Mandelbrot, Benoit ?.; Num- 
bers, Complex.

Fraction Operations 
A fraction compares two numbers by division. To conduct basic oper- 
ations, keep in mind that any number except 0 divided by itself is 1, and 1 
times any number is itself. That is, ? = 1, and 1X5 = 5. Thus, any num- 
ber divided or multiplied by a fraction equal to one will be itself. For ex- 
1 ? ?/ 3 r j r . 481 r 
ample, 5 X ? = 5 and 5 — -^ = 5. 
When multiplying fractions, the numerators (top numbers) are multi- 
plied together and the denominators (bottom numbers) are multiplied 
4.U ? 5 v 8 E X 8) 40 ? ? 4 v /: 4^6 24 
together. So ? X ? = ^^ = -- And ? X 6 = ? X ? = T. 
To divide fractions, rewrite the problem as multiplying by the recip- 
rocal (multiplicative inverse) of the divisor. So ? -?- -^ = ? X ? = y^-. 
To add fractions that have the same, or a common, denominator, sim- 
ply add the numerators, and use the common denominator. The figure be- 
low illustrates why this is true.

To correctly add ? and y, a common denominator must first be found. 
Usually, the least common multiple of the denominators (also called the 
least common denominator) is the best choice for the common denomina- 
tor. In the example below, the least common multiple of the two denomi- 
Fractions 
nators—2 and 3—is 6, so the least common denominator is 6. To convert 
the fractions, multiply ? by ? (which is equivalent to 1) to get ^. Similarly, 
multiply ? by ? (which is equivalent to 1) to get ^.

To model this problem visually, divide a rectangle into halves horizontally, 
then into thirds vertically, creating six equal parts (see the figure below). 
Shade one-half in color to show y, and then shade one-third in gray to show 
y. Since, as the figure shows, the upper left square has been shaded twice, 
it must be "carried" (see arrow). Now five of six squares are shaded; there-

Fractions 
Fractions are usually thought of as ?, ?, or maybe the decimal fraction 
0.5. Perhaps some think of a fraction as a part of a circle or 5 parts out 
of 10 parts. The word "fraction" itself is related to a word meaning bro- 
ken, as in "fracture." 
Historically, fractions have been thought of and written in many dif- 
ferent ways. Apparently the Babylonians, about 4,000 years ago, wrote frac- 
tions in a way similar to our decimal fractions, but instead of our base-10, 
they used base-60. They also used a space instead of a decimal point. This 
relatively simple system, however, does not reappear in common usage un- 
til about 3,600 years later in Europe. 
Understanding Fractions 
One mathematics dictionary defines a fraction as "a number less than 1." 
But this definition is too simple. The number ? is certainly not "less than 
one," but most people would still call it a fraction. Indeed, this same dic- 
base-10 a number 
system in which each 
place represents a 
power of 10 larger than 
the place to its right 
base-60 a number 
system used by ancient 
Mesopotamian cultures 
for some calculations in 
which each place repre- 
sents a power of 60 
larger than the place to 
its right

WHOLES AND PARTS 
The Greek mathematicians 
(around 600 b.c.e. to 600 c.e.) 
had some problem working with 
fractions because the number 1 
had a mystical significance as 
an indivisible unity. They did not 
want to break unity into parts, 
so they used ratios instead. 
whole numbers the 
positive integers and 
zero 
integer a positive 
whole number, its nega- 
tive counterpart, or zero 
rational number a 
number that can be writ- 
ten in the form a/b 
where a and b are inte- 
gers and b is not 0 
tionary calls j an improper fraction or "a fraction whose numerator is larger 
than the denominator." 
Another book defines a fraction as "a numeral representing some part 
of a whole." But what whole is ? representing part of, according to this de- 
finition? If a circle or a rectangle is divided into three equal parts, the de- 
nominator, or bottom, of the fraction is 3. But how many of those parts, or 
thirds, are represented by the fraction y? The numerator, or top, of the frac- 
tion tells you that ? represents five of the parts, each of which is one-third 
of a whole. 
Another way to define a fraction is as a number that can be expressed 
in the form j, where a and b are whole numbers and b is not equal to 0. 
But this definition, taken from another mathematics dictionary, has prob- 
lems too. The whole numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ... So does this definition 
mean that — ? is not a fraction? Although —2 is not a whole number, clearly 
—? is a fraction. 
A better definition—and one that holds up under scrutiny—is that a 
fraction is a numeral written in the form j where a can represent any num- 
ber and b can represent any number except 0. By this definition, -f^ is 
y 
a fraction, as are -^?-, —?~, and y, as well as ¦?• This definition names a frac- 
1 ?\?\ 
tion according to the form. This means that -y- is a fraction, and 50 is not 
a fraction. The values of the two numerals are the same, but the form of 
the numerals is not. 
However, it is useful to be able to talk about the numbers that can be 
expressed as the ratio, or quotient, of two integers, such as ?, ?, and —g. 
These numbers, which can be negative, are called rational numbers. All 
rational numbers can be written in the form of fractions; however, not all 
fractions are rational numbers. For example, the fraction ? is not a rational 
number because ?? is not an integer, see also Decimals; Form and Value; 
Fraction Operations; Numbers, Irrational; Numbers, Rational; Ratio, 
Rate, and Proportion.

In mathematics, function is a central idea. Imagine a machine that takes 
numbered balls from 1 through 26 and labels them with the English alpha- 
bet letters A through Z. This machine mimics a mathematical function. A 
function takes an object from one set A (the input) and maps it to an ob- 
ject in another set ? (the output). In mathematics, A and ? are usually sets 
of numbers. In symbols, this relationship is written zsf.A^B. 
So, a function fis the name of a relationship between two sets. Func- 
tions are usually denoted by the letters f, g, or h. A is called the domain 
(input), and ? is called the range (output). If the elements of the domain 
Functions and Equations 
are denoted by x, and the elements of the range are denoted by y, then a 
function can also be written as ? = f(x). This is read as "y is a function of 
x." Notice that this notation does not mean that/is multiplied by x. In- 
stead, the value of/depends on the value of x. 
Examples of Functions 
A simple example of a function is ? = f(x), where/(x) = x + 2. To each 
number x, add 2 to get y. When x is 3, ? is 5, and when x is 4, ? is 6. The 
value ? of the function,/(x), depends on the choice of x. The input, or x, is 
called the independent variable, and the output, or y, is called the depen- 
dent variable. 
Another example is a relationship between the positive integer set (do- 
main) and the even number set (range). To each positive integer n, the func- 
tion/G2) assigns a value of 2n. In symbols,/G2) = 2n. 
In a function, each element of the domain must map to exactly one el- 
ement of the range. However the opposite is not true. For example, f(x) = 
\x is a function. Each value of f(x) corresponds to two values of x. 
Now consider a function g with the real number set as the domain set. 
To each number x, g assigns 3 times x. That is, g(x) = 3x. 
Function Notation and Graphs 
Functions are visualized geometrically by plotting their graphs on a Carte- 
sian plane. You can plot a function by taking a few numbers from the do- 
main sets and finding their functional values. For example, g(x) = 3x would 
yield the points (—1, 3), @, 0), and A, 3). These points can be connected 
by a straight line. 
In functions such as/(x) = ???, g(x) = x + 2, or h(x) = (y)x, the power 
of the independent variable, x, is 1. Such functions are called linear func- 
tions. Plotting the graph of linear functions always produces straight lines. 
In contrast, consider the function/(x) = x2; its graph is not a straight line 
but rather a parabola, see also Mapping; Mathematical.

Galileo Galilei 
Italian Astronomer, Physicist, and Mathematician 
1564-1642 
Galileo Galilei is a pivotal figure in intellectual and scientific history. His 
ideas and activities were integral to the Scientific Revolution, which resulted 
in world-changing advances in science and technology, and in fundamental 
changes in the way reality is perceived. 
Galileo was born in Pisa, Italy, in 1564. In 1581, he entered the Uni- 
versity of Pisa, where his father wanted him to study medicine. But Galileo 
was interested in mathematics and philosophy, and he left the university 
without a degree. In 1589, he taught mathematics at the university, but lost 
his job by challenging Aristotelian teachings held by the university and the 
Catholic Church. However, he immediately became professor of mathe- 
matics at the University of Padua. 
Galileo was among the first to perceive that the natural world acts in a 
regular manner that can be interpreted and understood mathematically. Ap- 
plying this approach, he developed the concept of acceleration and discov- 
ered the law of falling bodies, explaining the movement of projectiles, 
pendulums, and objects moving on an inclined plane. 
Galileo accepted the Sun-centered model of the solar system that had 
been proposed by Copernicus. This model was in opposition to the Earth- 
centered model of Ptolemy that was accepted by scholars and the Catholic 
Church. Soon after the first telescope was invented, Galileo built his own 
version in 1609 and improved its magnification power. He was the first to 
use a telescope to study the heavens, obtaining, through these investigations, 
proof of the Copernican system. He discovered sunspots, valleys and moun- 
tains on the Moon, satellites circling Jupiter, and the phases of Venus. 
In 1610, Galileo published his observations and interpretations in The 
Starry Messenger, refuting Aristotle and Ptolemy and supporting Coperni- 
cus. Opposition came immediately from scholars and churchmen, who ac- 
cused him of heresy. 
In 1612, Galileo published a book on hydrostatics based on observa- 
tions, measurements, and mathematical analysis. He was again attacked by 
churchmen and university scholars for not adhering to the accepted Aris- 
totelian approach. He openly argued that physical evidence and mathemat- 
Galileo's many important 
discoveries put him in 
direct opposition to the 
Catholic Church, the 
ruling body of the time. 
Only centuries later would 
Galileo be cleared of 
heresy. 
Gamesh 
GALILEO'S BELIEF IN 
EMPIRICISM 
Galileo believed that the devel- 
opment of new ideas and under- 
standing was stifled by blind 
adherence to the authority of 
the Catholic Church and the 
writings of the ancient Greeks. 
Rather than simply accepting 
the statements of authorities, 
he believed investigators should 
rely on their own observations, 
measurements, and calcula- 
tions. 
ical proofs should not be made dependent on interpretations of scripture 
but that such interpretations should be subject to change when new evi- 
dence becomes available. Not surprisingly, the Catholic Church issued an 
edict in 1616 banning Copernicanism and censored Galileo's writings. 
Undaunted, in 1632 Galileo published Dialogue on the Two Chief World 
Systems contrasting the planetary models of Ptolemy and Copernicus, with 
clear preference for Copernicus. He was called to Rome and tried for heresy. 
Convicted, he was forced to publicly retract his ideas and placed on per- 
manent house arrest. His works were banned, but this order was essentially 
ignored outside of Italy. His ideas spread rapidly, gaining support through- 
out Europe. 
Galileo continued his work, and his last book, Discourses Concerning Two 
New Sciences, was published in Leiden in 1638. This classic volume presented 
a mechanical mathematical physics that eventually led to the development 
of what would be called Newtonian physics. Galileo died in 1642, the year 
of Isaac Newton's birth. In 1992, the Catholic Church rescinded its 1633 
conviction of Galileo as a heretic—350 years after his death, see also New- 
ton, Sir Isaac; Solar System Geometry, History of.

Games 
Have you ever played Tic-???-???? Did you win? Did you know that each 
Tic-???-??? game will always end in a tie unless one player makes a mis- 
take? 
There are nine squares on a Tic-???-??? game board, so the first player 
has nine choices for the first move. The second player has eight choices for 
the second move (one square is taken), which makes a total of 72 possible 
arrangements after the first two turns. After five turns, there are 15,120 pos- 
sible arrangements. 
Someone could possibly win on the sixth turn if the other player played 
really badly, so the nine possible winning positions must be subtracted from 
the total, leaving 60,471 arrangements after only six moves. No one can 
keep track of that many combinations, but that is not necessary. The suc- 
cessful Tic-???-??? strategy is simply to block the other player's moves 
while hoping the other player makes a mistake. 
A good chess player must use a sequence of opening moves that will 
yield the best possible position. In chess, the player in control of the white 
pieces (White) always moves first. Since only the eight pawns and two 
knights can move on the first move, there are twelve possible first moves 
for White. (The two knights can each move to two different positions). 
There are also twelve different opening moves for the player control- 
ling the black pieces (Black), so after only two moves, there are 144 differ- 
Gaming 
ent possible arrangements of pieces on the board. Each move opens up other 
pieces that can move, so after only four moves, there are about 70,000 dif- 
ferent possible arrangements of pieces on the chessboard. Not every arrange- 
ment is of equal value, but with 70,000 different positions to consider, it is 
difficult for even good players to keep track of all possibilities. So good chess 
players remember patterns of pieces and learn to recognize certain patterns 
that give them an advantage over their opponents. 
A great deal of mathematics is therefore involved in most games. Poker 
players must calculate the probabilities of certain card arrangements in or- 
der to win. (Never draw to an inside straight!) Bridge players must use prob- 
ability to calculate the possible arrangements of cards in their opponents' 
hands in order to decide which strategy to use in playing winningly. 
Bridge Strategies 
Bridge players use mathematics in evaluating their hands. In one popular 
system, an ace is worth four points, a king is worth three points, a queen is 
worth two points, and a jack is worth only one point. Players also count dis- 
tribution points. Having no cards of one suit is worth three points, a sin- 
gleton is worth two points, and only two cards of a suit is worth one point. 
Evaluating the hand this way allows a player to determine if a hand is "bid- 
dable." 
Once play starts, math is used to determine how best to play the cards. 
For example, in a typical hand, one side may have nine cards of the trump 
suit, which means the other side has four trump cards. Suppose the missing 
cards are the queen, 8, 6, and 3. How are those cards likely to be distrib- 
uted between the opponents' two hands? One opponent could have all four 
trump cards, one could have three cards, and the other opponent one card, 
or each opponent might have two cards. The mathematics of probabilities 
shows that the most likely arrangement is for one opponent to have three 
of the missing trump cards. So a player cannot depend on capturing the 
missing queen by simply leading the ace and king, see also Probability, 
Theoretical.

Gaming 
Recent years have indicated a change in the locality of legalized casino gam- 
bling across the United States. Until 1978 gaming, as it is commonly called, 
was available only in Nevada. Today, however, the casino business has ex- 
panded to other states. One reason for the increase in the number of gam- 
bling places is that many people enjoy playing these games of chance. 
Another critical factor is the profit margins realized by entrepreneurs in the 
casino industry. 
Casinos offer a wide range of games to meet the interests of their clien- 
tele. Blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and craps are among the popular games. 
All casino games share two important characteristics that are critical to their

continued success. On the one hand, each game is exciting because the un- 
predictable nature of probabilistic outcomes makes it possible for a player 
to be lucky and win in the short run. On the other hand, the significant 
"house edge" associated with each of these games ensures that in the long 
run the bettor will lose and the casino will win money. To better under- 
stand the risks of casino gambling, consider the chances of winning in 
roulette and blackjack. 
Roulette 
The simplest of casino games to analyze from the perspective of theoreti- 
cal probability is roulette. In this game a small ball is rolled onto a revolv- 
ing tray containing thirty-eight numbered compartments. The ball randomly 
comes to rest in one of these thirty-eight compartments. In addition to the 
compartments numbered from 1 to 36, there are two extras numbered 0 and 
00. It is these last two numbers that provide the casino with their edge. 
The bettor has several options when playing roulette. If a particular 
number is chosen, the player will win $35 for every dollar bet if that num- 
ber occurs. In this case, if a winning bet of $2 is placed the bettor will re- 
ceive $72 in return, 35 to 1 on each dollar bet, plus the original $2 bet. The 
bettor may also choose to bet on the color of the number hit (eighteen are 
red and eighteen are black), whether the number is even or odd @ and 00 
are considered neither even nor odd), or whether the number hit will be 1 
through 18, or 19 through 36. 
In each of these bets, the probability of winning is 18/38 because in each 
case there are eighteen favorable results out of the total number of thirty- 
eight possible outcomes. Finally, the player can get 2 to 1 odds by betting 
that the number will be from 1 to 12, 13 to 24, or 25 to 36. 
One interesting aspect of roulette is that the "strategy" used in choos- 
ing from the aforementioned betting options has absolutely no effect on the 
expected value of the win or loss on that bet. To show this, the expected 
value of each of these options can be calculated. In a nutshell, the expected 
Gaming 
value is the average amount that a player would win or lose on a bet. A pos- 
itive expected value indicates that the game is favorable and that on aver- 
age the player will win money, whereas a negative expected value indicates 
that the player will on average lose money. 
If 0 and 00 were not included on the roulette wheel, the expected value 
on any wager would be 0, indicating that in the long run, the average win 
or loss for the bettor would be zero. To calculate the expected value, mul- 
tiply the probability of each of the expected outcomes by the amount won 
or lost by the player given that outcome. Thus without 0 and 00, a player 
betting on even or odd would expect to win 50 percent of the time and lose 
the other 50 percent of the time. 
If a bet of X dollars is made, the expected value is @.5)(-X) + @.5) 
(+X) = 0. Similarly, on the 36 number wheel, the expected win or loss on 
a bet of $X on an individual number is 0. The player wins ^rth of the time 
35 • 35 
and loses ^ths of the time, making the expected value (^r) 
(—X) + (^r)(+35X) = 0. Any game with an expected value of 0 is referred 
to as a fair game and will not be found in any casino! 
The green numbers 0 and 00 provide the casino with its edge. If a bet 
is made on an individual number, the probability of winning is ^, since 
there are now 38 equally likely outcomes that can occur. Calculating the ex- 
pected value for betting $X on an individual number yields the following 
equation: (f|)( -X) + (-L)(+35X) = ("^)X = (~)K. Thus the expected 
value is approximately —0.053 times the amount of the wager. This means 
that the player on average will lose a little more than 5 cents on every dol- 
lar bet. 
An even or odd bet has a probability of ^ of winning since 0 and 00 are 
considered neither even nor odd. Calculating the expected value for the player 
betting $X on even or odd yields the following equation: (^)(—X) + (^)(+X) 
= (—-^g)X = (—?^)?. Thus the expected value on this type of bet is exactly 
the same as that of betting on an individual number. The reader is encour- 
aged to perform the appropriate calculations to verify that betting on 1 
through 12 also yields an expected value of —0.053 multiplied by the amount 
of the bet. In roulette, therefore, no matter what strategy is used, the disad- 
vantage to the player remains constant. 
Some gamblers, however, feel they can win by trying to determine what 
is "due" to happen on a particular trial. For example, if the previous four 
numbers have been red, some feel that black is more likely to occur the next 
time. They reason that because attaining red five times in a row is extremely 
unlikely, the next result is more likely to be black. The fallacy here is that 
although the probability of red occurring five times in a row is indeed very 
unlikely, the unlikely event of four consecutive reds has already occurred. 
Because successive trials of a roulette wheel are independent of one an- 
other, the next number has the same chance of being red or black as in pre- 
vious trials, -^g-. Thus playing this "hunch" strategy does not make the player 
any more (or less) likely to win as the expected value for each trial remains 
—0.053 times the amount bet. 
Blackjack 
Blackjack is perhaps the most complex of casino games and for this reason 
has been the subject of considerable analysis by gamblers. Calculating the 
Gaming 
expected value of a hand of blackjack is an extremely difficult task for sev- 
eral reasons. First, there are many ways in which a hand can be dealt to the 
player and the dealer. Second, almost every casino offers slightly different 
rule variations of the game. Finally, unlike roulette, the decisions made by 
the player throughout the course of a hand dramatically affect the chances 
of winning. 
In the game of blackjack, picture cards have a value of 10, aces can be 
counted as 1 or 11, and all other cards take on the value of the card. The 
game begins with the player and the dealer each being dealt two cards. The 
player's goal is to come closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, 
known as busting. After seeing both of their cards and one of the dealer's 
cards (commonly called the "dealer's up card"), the player must decide how 
to proceed. The player can "stay" with the present total, take another card 
("hit"), double the wager and be given one and only one more card, or split 
a pair by placing another bet equal to the original and then proceeding with 
two separate hands. 
In the majority of cases, the only reasonable decision is to take a hit or 
stand with the current total. Should the player take a hit, he or she can take 
additional hits until either the total of the cards exceeds 21 or the player does 
not want any more cards. The player loses immediately if the sum of the 
cards exceeds 21. If the player stops taking cards without exceeding 21, it is 
the dealer's turn to act. In casino versions of blackjack, the dealer does not 
make decisions but instead the dealer's play is fixed. The dealer must hit 
whenever her total is 16 or less and must stay when her total is 17 or more. 
Many books on blackjack provide a basic strategy that is considered op- 
timal for the player. Optimal basic strategy is determined by considering 
every possible combination of the player's hand and the dealer's up card and 
making the play that yields the best expected value in each case. Depend- 
ing on the rule variations, most authors claim that by playing a sound ba- 
sic strategy the house advantage will only be about 2 to 3 percent. Although 
this disadvantage is less than that of roulette, we must keep in mind that it 
is based on the player making the correct decisions at all times. Unlike 
roulette, the quality of the decisions made in the course of playing has a 
dramatic effect on the chances of winning. In practice, most players do not 
consistently make the optimal decisions and for this reason, many blackjack 
players lose at a much faster rate than they otherwise should. 
How the House Stays Ahead 
A simple example will show how the casino gains its advantage as the num- 
ber of games played increases. Suppose we consider a situation in which the 
player has a 40 percent chance of winning and a 60 percent chance of los- 
ing each game with the amount won or lost in each game being equal. If 
three games are played, the player must win two or three games in order to 
be ahead. The probability of this occurring is 3(.4)(.4)(.6) + 1(.4)(.4)(.4) = 
35 percent, because there are three ways in which the player can win two 
out of three games. That is, the probability of this occurring is (.4)(.4)(.6) 
for each of the three ways, and there is one way of winning all three games, 
the probability of which is (.4)(.4)(.4). Similarly, the probability of winning 
three or more games in five is 
10(.4)(.4)(.4)(.6)(.6) + 5(.4)(.4)(.4)(.4)(.6) + 1(.4)(.4)(.4)(.4)(.4) = 32 percent. 
Gardner, Martin 
Further analysis of more games played can be done using the binomial 
distribution. The successive probabilities of the player winning when the 
game is played 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 times are 0.29, 0.266, 0.246, 0.228, 
0.212, 0.198, and 0.187, respectively. 
The probability of winning decreases with the duration that a gambler 
plays. In a casino, a gambler may play hundreds of hands of blackjack or 
games of roulette consecutively, yet the chances of the player being ahead 
after a lengthy session are extremely small. Furthermore, from the casino's 
perspective, thousands of hands of blackjack and games of roulette are be- 
ing played every hour by their numerous patrons, nearly around the clock. 
Given this huge number of trials, the casinos are assured of making large 
profits. SEE ALSO PROBABILITY AND THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS; PROBA-

Gardner, Martin 
American Author 
1914- 
One of the most well-known creators of mathematical puzzles is Martin 
Gardner. From 1957 to 1982, he wrote a column for Scientific American 
called "Mathematical Recreations." He presented intriguing problems, dis- 
cussed the mathematics of various games, and demonstrated recreational as- 
pects of mathematical discoveries. He always aimed to entertain and 
stimulate his readers, which ranged from high school students to college 
professors. 
Early Work 
Born in 1914 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Martin Gardner became fascinated with 
mathematics in high school when he took Pauline Baker's geometry course. 
She communicated a love for the subject that he readily absorbed. Gardner 
also had other academic interests. He graduated from the University of 
Chicago in 1936, with a major in philosophy, and did graduate work in the 
philosophy of science. 
Most of Gardner's early writing had little to do with philosophy or math- 
ematics. Before World War II, he worked as a reporter for the Tulsa Tri- 
bune. After serving in the U.S. Navy, he supported himself as a freelance 
writer, working for eight years as a contributing editor to Humpty Dumpty's 
Magazine. This ended in 1957 when, drawing on his interest in magic, he 
sold his first article to Scientific American. 
Fascinated when a magician showed him a paper toy called a hexa- 
flexagon, Gardner contacted the inventor, John Tukey, a mathematician at 
Princeton, and with Tukey's permission and help, he wrote an article about 
hexaflexagons and the mathematics behind them. Delighted, the Scientific 
American editors published it and asked for more. Martin Gardner scoured 
Martin Gardner is a pro- 
lific writer and an expan- 
sive, stimulating thinker. 
Many of his columns and 
books are about mathe- 
matics. 
Gardner, Martin 
New York City for old books on recreational mathematics and found enough 
material to get the column going. Shortly thereafter, he began to draw ma- 
terial from recreational mathematics journals. 
Gardner had a gift for simplifying ideas and communicating them wit- 
tily in a warm, playful spirit. His writing was so well received that mathe- 
maticians whose work had recreational aspects—Solomon Golomb, John 
Conway, Roger Penrose, and Frank Harary, among others—shared their 
discoveries with him. Through these contacts his columns became more so- 
phisticated, and he enabled mathematicians to present their work to a much 
larger audience. 
Popular Columns 
Central to his work was the belief that mathematics, whether formal or recre- 
ational, is enormously interesting and of vital importance to humankind. 
Mathematics is the solving of puzzles. Good puzzles, even if they appear to 
be of trivial importance, open the door to all sorts of useful interconnec- 
tions, often leading to "better and better answers to puzzles posed by na- 
ture." 
One of his most popular columns was on John Conway's Game of Life, 
a population simulation game. A few counters are placed on a large checker- 
board. Counters are born or die according to these rules: 
A) a counter survives to the next round if it has two or three neighbor- 
ing counters; 
B) a counter dies if it has four or more neighbors or one or zero neigh- 
bors; and 
C) each empty cell with exactly three neighbors will give birth to a new 
counter in the next round. 
The game is fascinating because of the great variety of population be- 
haviors that arise from different beginning arrangements of counters. 
Another favorite article was on a method of encoding messages called 
trapdoor functions, which are functions whose inverses—the key to decod- 
ing the message—are computationally impossible to discover in thousands 
of years. Martin Gardner's article was the first to discuss the work of Ron 
Rivest, who combined trapdoor functions with prime number factorization, 
creating coding systems that could be used in the electronic transmission of 
information over the Internet.

The math puzzles Gardner presented to the public were enjoyed by peo- 
ple of all ages, and offered a variety of problems for readers to solve. Some 
examples include: 
A boy and a girl were talking. "I'm a boy," said the one with black 
hair. "I'm a girl," said the one with red hair. If at least one of them 
is lying, who has black hair? [From Wheels, Life, and Other

lowest point reached by the center of gravity C. [From Wheels, Life, 
and Other Mathematical Amusements, 1983] 
The game of Sim: put six dots on a paper, forming the vertices of a 
regular hexagon. Each player in turn connects two of the dots; one 
player uses a blue color, the other a red color. The first player 
forced to form a triangle of his own color loses. What is the best 
strategy? [From Knotted Doughnuts and Other Mathematical 
Entertainments, 1987] 
A paradox: a man who always keeps his promises tells his wife that 
"tomorrow for your birthday I will give you an unexpected gift. 
You have no way of guessing what it is. It is the gold bracelet we 
saw at the jewelry store." Will his wife be surprised or not? [From 
The Unexpected Hanging and Other Mathematical Diversions, 1991] 
Gardner also created the mysterious Dr. Matrix as a foil for playing with 
numerology. Here, for example, is Dr. Matrix's proof that William Shake- 
speare helped translate the King James Bible: In Psalm 46, the 46th word 
from the beginning is SHAKE and the 46th word from the end is SPEAR. 
Furthermore, the King James Version was completed in 1610 when Shake- 
speare was 46 years old. see also Puzzles, Number.

Genome, Human 
The word "genome" means the totality of all the genetic information pre- 
sent in the cells of an organism. Most of this genetic information is con- 
tained in chromosomes. A chromosome consists of deoxyribonucleic acid 
Genome, Human 
(DNA) molecules wound up into a compact bundle. Humans have 46 chro- 
mosomes in their cells, organized into 23 corresponding pairs.* 
The DNA in the chromosomes of an organism consists of a double- 
stranded molecule formed from four basic units that are repeated many 
times. The four basic units are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made 
of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nucleotide base. The sugars in the nu- 
cleotides stack up and link together to form a backbone for one strand of 
the DNA molecule, leaving the nucleotide bases projecting. The four kinds 
of nucleotide bases found in DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and 
thymine. A fifth nucleotide base, uracil, is found in ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
in place of thymine. 
The nucleotide bases of DNA are usually designated as A, C, G, and T 
(or U) respectively. In the double-stranded DNA molecule, each nucleotide 
base forms a bond with a nucleotide base on the other strand of the mole- 
cule, such that A always pairs with T, and ? with G. These two strands then 
wrap around each other, forming a structure known as a double helix. The 
two strands are antiparallel so that the sequence of bases starting from one 
end on one strand is repeated, starting from the opposite end on the other 
strand. 
A gene is a unique sequence of bases that occupies a particular position 
on a chromosome. A single strand of DNA contains hundreds of individual 
genes. However, there are several different types of genes included in a DNA 
molecule. Structural genes code for particular amino acid sequences. These 
are the genes that contain instructions on how to build proteins. Operator 
genes control the structural genes and regulate their output. Regulatory 
genes may produce repressor proteins that turn the operator genes on or 
off or they may act like punctuation marks, signaling the beginning and end 
of coding sequences. Suppressor genes may suppress the actions of other 
genes and can reverse the effects of a harmful mutation. Kinetic genes reg- 
ulate the chromosomes themselves. The 30,000 or so genes in every human 
cell code for more than one million different proteins including albumin 
and hemoglobin; brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin; hormones 
like insulin, testosterone, and estrogen; and the countless enzymes that keep 
us alive. 
Mathematics of the DNA Code 
Structural genes responsible for the production of the amino acid sequences 
used to build proteins are the best understood of the different kinds of genes. 
To produce a protein, a section of DNA becomes "unzipped," exposing the 
nucleotide bases. A molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized by 
pairing up nucleotide bases. Each group of three nucleotide bases on the 
RNA molecule, called a codon, codes for a particular amino acid. Since there 
are four choices (A, C, G, and U) for each of the three-nucleotide bases, 
each codon can be one of 64 different "words" DX4X4 = 64). However, 
there are only 20 different amino acids. Several different codons produce 
the same amino acid. For example, UUU and UUC both produce the amino 
acid phenylalanine. There are also three codons, UAA, UGA, and UAG, 
that act as "stop" signals ending the protein chain. 
A protein contains around 100 amino acids, so a structural gene must 
contain at least 300 nucleotide bases. Using this logic, it might then be ex-

THE IMPORTANCE OF 
MAPPING THE HUMAN 
GENOME 
Many genetic diseases can 
result from a misspelling in the 
DNA sequence. Since each DNA 
codon codes for a particular 
amino acid, a change in one 
nucleotide base can result in a 
different protein being produced. 
If that protein is essential to 
health, a genetic disease 
results. For example, normal 
hemoglobin differs from the 
hemoglobin of sickle-cell anemia 
by only one amino acid out of 
hundreds. 
The genetic maps being devel- 
oped by the Human Genome 
Project are available on the 
Internet and are updated fre- 
quently, making accurate 
genetic information accessible 
to every researcher and opening 
up great potential for improving 
human health through research. 
pected that the human genetic code would contain 10 million genes. How- 
ever, DNA also contains stop and start codons, other regulatory molecules, 
some sequences (called introns) that are removed before protein synthesis 
begins, duplicate genes, non-coding sequences, redundant genes, and other 
non-functioning bits of DNA. As a result, there are probably only around 
30,000 individual genes among the 3 billion nucleotide units of human 
chromosomes. 
The Human Genome Project 
The U.S. Human Genome Project (HGP) is a joint effort of the Depart- 
ment of Energy (DOE) and National Institute of Health (NIH). The goal 
of the Human Genome Project is to decipher human heredity through the 
creation of maps for each of the 23 human chromosomes. The first step in 
this process is to determine the actual DNA code. In June, 2000, then-U.S. 
President Clinton, leaders of the Human Genome Project, and officers of 
Celera Genomics (a private biotechnology firm) jointly announced that the 
rough draft of the human genetic code was ready for publication. The Feb- 
ruary 16, 2001 issue of Science published articles related to the work of Cel- 
era Genomics, and the February 15, 2001 issue of Nature published articles 
relating to the work of the Human Genome Project. 
As of July 30, 2001, only the two smallest human chromosomes, 21 and 
22, were completely sequenced to the level of accuracy specified by the pro- 
tocols established by the Human Genome Project. At the time this article 
was written, 47.1 percent of human DNA had been mapped to final stan- 
dards and 51.4 percent had been mapped to preliminary standards for a to- 
tal of 98.5 percent mapped. 
The final publication of the human genome map is expected by 2003. 
However, this final draft will include only the human genome code. Still to 
be determined are the exact number and locations of genes, how genes are 
regulated, how the DNA sequence is organized, how chromosomes are or- 
ganized, which parts of the DNA are redundant or noncoding, how gene 
expression is coordinated, how genetic information is conserved, and many 
other concepts essential to understanding the human genetic code, see also

Geography is the study of the physical and geopolitical aspects of the sur- 
face of Earth. Physical geography describes the different surface and cli- 
matic conditions around the world. Political geography is concerned with 
the division of the world into various levels of government, human activity, 
and production. Geography is not confined to merely describing Earth as 
it is now, but also understanding how it has evolved and how it may change 
in the future. 
The problems that faced humankind at the dawn of history stimulated 
both geography and mathematics. In fact, much of early mathematics was 
concerned with making measurements of the land; so much so that a whole 
branch of mathematics became known as Earth-measurement, which in 
Greek is geometry. Geometry as a mathematical study is less concerned with 
its practical roots, but for geographers, geometry and trigonometry are in- 
valuable tools. 
Outside of the activities associated with mapmaking, geography was for 
many years mainly descriptive. The information collected about the physi- 
cal and social characteristics of the world was reported in a narrative form 
with little attempt to analyze the data that had been collected. In the late 
1940s and early 1950s, a revolution took place in geography when the ac- 
ceptance of any theory within the science became subject to mathematical 
analysis. As with other sciences, geography began to use mathematics as the 
language to describe relationships in the discipline. 
The Geographic Matrix 
An observation made by a geographer has two main attributes—a loca- 
tion and a physical attribute associated with that location. Each place may 
have more than one characteristic and each characteristic may be found 
at more than one location. These data can be recorded in a matrix with 
rows representing characteristics and columns the places where the 
matrix a rectangular

and columns 
City planners and archi- 
tects must have an

matics and physical and

sions can be made 
about the whole set or

observations have been taken. The organization of data into a matrix 
greatly aids geographers with the mathematical analysis of the informa- 
tion they gather. 
Before geographers collect data, they must select the locations within 
the region where they will measure the characteristics of interest. This re- 
quires an understanding of the sampling techniques found in mathemati- 
cal statistics. From statistical sampling theories the geographer calculates 
how many locations will be required, which will consequently reveal the 
number of columns in the matrix. In establishing the appropriate number 
of locations, it is necessary to ensure that there is sufficient data so that the 
samples are representative of the whole region. 
Three main types of sampling systems are used in selecting locations. 
The first type is a totally random sample, in which each location in the 
study is selected at random from all possible points in the region. The 
second type of sample is a systematic sample, in which an initial point is 
chosen at random and all other points are determined by fixed intervals 
from the randomly chosen point. The third type of sample is a stratified 
sample, in which the region is subdivided into subregions. Within the 
subregions, points are chosen by either using a totally random sample, or 
a stratified sample, or by dividing into further subdivisions. This process 
can continue until the degree of accuracy required matches the number 
of sampling points. For example, in studying a country, a geographer may 
first break the country into regions. Then the regions may subdivide by 
using political divisions such as a state, and this may go further by using 
counties, and at this level there may be a random selection of sampling 
points. 
Ultimately, the selection of sampling locations should permit a rapid, 
accurate, and economical amount of calculation in order to analyze the data. 
The selection process should also be such that final analysis is comparable 
to data collected in other regions so that regional comparisons may be made. 
In addition, consideration needs to be given to national and international 
standards, and to enabling comparisons with data collected over time. 
Analysis of the Geographical Matrix 
When the collected data have been placed in a geographic matrix, an analy- 
sis of a region can proceed in many ways. One common method of analy- 
sis is an examination of how a characteristic is distributed over a region by 
examining the row of the matrix for that characteristic. For example, atten- 
tion may be focused on the way in which the rural population is distributed 
over an area such as the Great Plains of the United States. 
Secondly, a geographer may try to get an understanding of the com- 
plexity of a location by identifying its characteristics. In other words, the 
column for that location may be analyzed. For instance, interest may be 
in the rainfall, soil type, or most successful crop production at a location 
in order to make recommendations for other places with similar charac- 
teristics. If the location is an urban area, a geographer might try to con- 
nect transportation access data, raw material availability, and expert labor 
supply, in order to explain why a particular industry is successful at that 
location. 
Geography 
A third way to make comparisons is between rows. This enables an un- 
derstanding of which characteristics are found together or separately, or to 
what degree they might mix. For example, looking at common characteris- 
tics for two economically successful locations can show why they contribute 
to the locations' success. 
A fourth option for a method of analysis is to make a comparison of 
columns. This allows the geographer to describe which locations are simi- 
lar and which are very different. For instance, by analyzing locations where 
the weather data are the same, a geographer can classify climates that are 
similar. All of these analyses require the statistical techniques of correlation 
and regression (defining and characterizing relationships among data). 
Optimization Problems Solved by Geographers 
Although mathematics has become an essential tool of modern geography, 
it was also present in the geography of the nineteenth century. In 1826, Von 
Thtinen collected data on land values in agricultural communities; he also 
collected data on how farmers used land. His data were centered on a town 
that was the main market for a region. 
Von Thtinen found that for each particular type of crop the costs of 
getting the produce to market was a product of the distance from town, r, 
the volume of the crop produced in a unit area of land, v, and the cost of 
transportation per unit of distance, ? If the crop sells at a price of p and the 
fixed costs of producing the crop are a, then the net profit is expressed as 
R = (p — d)v — rev. 
Von Thtinen constructed graphs of profit R plotted against the distance 
from town, r for various crops. The figure above shows the graphs for three 
crops. Crop 1 produces the highest profit as long as it is inside a distance 
of rj of the market. Between a distance of r7 and r2 crop 2 is the most prof- 
itable, and between r2 and r3 crop 3 is the most profitable. At r3 all three 
crops become unprofitable. Von Thtinen suggested that the land around a 
market be used to reflect these rings, and that there should be no cultiva- 
Geography 
tion of these crops beyond r3 at all, as there was no profit in farming at this 
distance (see below). 
The modern equivalent of this geographical distribution model is the 
understanding of why the location of a shopping center or a factory af- 
fects each one's success or failure. From the geographical matrix the lo- 
cations of various resources that are required by a manufacturing plant can 
be established. Given the locations of different raw materials, labor re- 
sources, and transportation of raw materials to the factory, the location 
for the optimum manufacturing plant can be calculated and compared to 
an existing plant. 
A geographer's data can also be used to support or refute the location 
of a manufacturing plant at a particular location. However, this is only part 
of the solution, for once the goods have been manufactured they have to be 
distributed to market centers, and this has an associated cost that can affect 
the decision concerning a manufacturing plant's location. By weighting dis- 
tances with regard to cost, an optimum location can be found by finding the 
equivalent of the center of gravity of the system. 
In the location of a factory, one of the problems that has to be tackled 
is the distribution of the product to market. Here another branch of math- 
ematics aids the analysis. Graphs and trees deal with the analysis of net- 
works, and can be employed in finding solutions to this part of the problem. 
One of the classic problems of networks, the travelling salesman problem, 
is concerned with the most efficient route for a travelling salesman to take 
in order to cover all the customers. This is also the route that the supply 
trucks will be interested in following. The full understanding of this prob- 
lem is still the object of mathematical research. 
Calculus in Geography 
A major problem of geography is the modeling of population change. 
Change in populations implies that geographers are interested in data that 
are time dependent. Therefore any data collection has to be repeated at var- 
ious intervals, the most familiar way being the United States census that is 
required every 10 years by law. 
Geography 
The census gives data over long periods of time, but annual sampling 
is necessary in order to monitor more detailed changes. The data can then 
be matched to a mathematical model. The most common model for popu- 
lation growth results in the construction of a differential equation in which 
the change in population, with respect to time, varies directly with time and 
can be solved through calculus. 
Calculus also helps model the way in which the profile of a hill devel- 
ops. Another application of calculus gives a mathematical model of the freez- 
ing of water in a lake. If air above a lake maintains temperatures below the 
freezing point of water for a prolonged period of time, the thickness of the 
ice will continue to increase. The rate of advance of the ice depends on the 
rate at which heat can be carried away from the surface by convection cur- 
rents in the water below the ice surface. The model leads to a differential 
equation. 
Fractals and River Watersheds 
The way in which rivers begin their life as a collection of small springs or 
gullies that collect rain and spill into brooks or streams has been better un- 
derstood in recent times by the analysis offered by mathematics through 
fractals. In river systems, fractal scaling can be seen in the organization of 
the river network at various levels of observation; that is, they conform to 
the fractals first described by Benoit B. Mandelbrot. Research around 1990 
described the scaling properties of the geometry of several river systems and 
a calculation was made of their fractal dimension. 
Probability and the Layout of Villages 
Probability leads to an understanding of the way villages develop over a long 
period of time, given that there has been no deliberate planning. The model 
requires the description of two objects, a closed cell with an entrance, and 
an open cell (see figure below).

These cells are joined together to form a doublet so that the entrance al- 
ways faces onto an open cell—corresponding to a house opening out onto 
the public space. In the modeling process, the doublets are allowed to ac- 
cumulate with the condition that each new doublet that joins the village 
does so with its open cell having at least one edge common with another 
open cell. Which open cell a new doublet joins is chosen at random. This 
modeling process has been successful in describing a number of old villages 
in which town planning did not influence the layout, see also Cartogra-

Geometry Software, Dynamic 
Tucked in with the business news of the day was this headline from the De- 
cember 9, 1996 issue of The Wall Street Journal newspaper: "Teen Math 
Whizzes Go Euclid One Better." High-schoolers David Goldenheim and 
Daniel Litchfield had revisited a 2,000-year old challenge from the Greek 
mathematician Euclid and solved it in a new way. Given an arbitrary seg- 
ment, the freshmen found a geometric recipe for dividing its length into any 
number of equal parts. The mathematics community hailed the students' 
work as "elegant" and "significant." 
Goldenheim and Litchfield devised their segment-splitting technique 
through old-fashioned conjecturing and reasoning. Yet there was nothing 
traditional about their geometric tools of choice. The duo conducted their 
experiments without the aid of a compass or even a ruler. Instead, they 
turned to technology and a new breed of computer software programs known 
collectively as "dynamic geometry." 
At first glance, the word "dynamic" might sound like an odd way to de- 
scribe geometry. The dictionary defines "dynamic" as "characterized by vig- 
orous activity and producing or undergoing change," but the images in 
geometry textbooks are immobile, forever frozen in place. 
Consider a picture of a triangle. Any illustration represents a particular 
triangle with specific side lengths and angle measures. Triangles, however, 
can be small, large, narrow, or wide. No single image captures this gener- 
ality. 
By contrast, a triangle drawn with dynamic geometry software possesses 
more freedom. With a click and a drag of the mouse, you can tug a corner 
of the triangle and watch the object adjust before your eyes. The shape re- 
mains triangular, but its sides and angles grow and shrink in a smooth, con-

tinuous motion. The effect is similar to an animated movie, only here you 
are the one controlling the movement. 
In science, you devise experiments and then test your theories. Mathe- 
matics classes often have fostered a more hands-off approach: textbooks state 
what to prove. With dynamic geometry software, mathematics regains its 
rightful place as a laboratory science. Any object constructed on the screen 
allows you to roll up your sleeves and search for patterns. 
Suppose you draw an arbitrary quadrilateral, find the midpoints of its 
four sides, and then connect these points to their adjacent partners (see the 
leftmost picture below). By doing so, you form a new quadrilateral (repre- 
sented by dashed segments) nested inside the original. Measuring its sides 
and angles with the software reveals a surprise. Opposite sides are equal in 
length and parallel—the very qualities of a parallelogram. A coincidence? 
A mouse tug to any corner of the outer quadrilateral reconfigures the 
construction into new positions. Within seconds, you can view hundreds of 
quadrilaterals, each with their midpoints connected. In every one, the dashed 
quadrilateral remains a parallelogram. Even a twisted pretzel shape cannot 
disturb the parallel sides (see the rightmost picture). Such visual evidence is 
quite compelling; it is not a watertight proof, and it does not explain why 
we should expect to see a parallelogram, but it is a useful start. 
A Brief History 
As director of Swarthmore College's Visual Geometry Project, Eugene Klotz 
was among the founders of the dynamic geometry movement. His original 
goals for geometry software were relatively modest. Bothered by the cum- 
bersome nature of ruler-and-compass constructions, Klotz imagined a soft- 
ware package that would make it easier to draw shapes like lines and circles. 
He comments: 
Basic motor skills were keeping students from being able to draw. I 
thought we needed to have something that allowed people to make 
the basic constructions. So to me, our software was a drawing tool. 
You'd make a geometric drawing that was precise and accurate, and 
scroll over the page to see what was going on. 
This vision of geometry software was a non-interactive one: once drawn, 
objects on the screen could not be reshaped via mouse dragging. The miss- 
ing "dynamic" element was to come from a student, Nicholas Jackiw, whom 
Klotz advised during Jackiw's freshman year at Swarthmore. 
Jackiw was perhaps an unlikely choice for a mathematics project. He 
had steered away from mathematics in high school and college, focusing in- 
stead on English and computer science. Still, when Jackiw viewed Klotz's 
Geometry Software, Dynamic 
geometry proposal, he sensed something was missing. Jackiw's interest in 
programming computer games provided an unexpected source of inspira- 
tion. If a computer game could immerse players in an interactive world, then 
why not geometry? Jackiw says: 
It's the video game aspect that gives me my sense of interactivity 
when dealing with geometry . . . Looking at the input devices of 
video games is a tremendously educational experience. In the old 
days, you had games with very interesting controls that were highly 
specific. . .The video game Tempest had a marvelous input 
device. . .The types of games they would write to suit this bizarre 
and unique device were always interesting experiments in what 
does this hand motion transport you to in your imagination. 1 
wanted to have a good feel in all of my games. 
The mouse of a Macintosh computer was not an ideal input device for 
games, but it was suitable for virtual environments where objects could be 
dragged. The illustration program MacDraw, in particular, contained the 
rudimentary features of dynamic geometry, as one could draw and move a 
segment with the mouse and change its length. When Jackiw took the ba- 
sic premise of MacDraw and applied it (with considerable reworking) to 
geometry, Klotz found the results striking: 
I remember how shocked I was when I first saw it. Jackiw had played 
with a Macintosh long enough to know that you should be able to 
drag the vertex or a side of a triangle and protrude the figure. I 
was flabbergasted. I mean, he made the connection, and I didn't. 
One of the earliest programs to showcase the graphical capabilities of 
the computer was Ivan Sutherland's "Sketchpad." A hand-held light pen al- 
lowed the user to draw and manipulate points, line segments, and arcs on a 
cathode ray tube monitor. In honor of Sutherland's work, Klotz named their 
new program, "The Geometer's Sketchpad." The product received its com- 
mercial release in the spring of 1991. 
Interestingly, the Swarthmore group was not alone in its thinking. 
Working in France, Jean-Marie Laborde and his programming team si- 
multaneously developed the software package Cabri Geometry, which also 
featured dynamic movement. Initially, neither the Sketchpad nor Cabri peo- 
ple knew of the other's existence. When Laborde and Klotz finally met, they 
marveled at the similarities in their software. Klotz says: 
We had just that Fall got into our dragging bit, and were very proud 
of what we had. We thought, God, people are going to really love 
this. But Cabri had scooped us, and we had scooped them. It was 
one of these, you know, just amazing things where . . . maybe you 
can sort out the exact moment, maybe there was a passing meteor, 
or something. 
Student Exploration 
Dynamic geometry software programs are great for learning geometry, and 
they can also be fun. The top picture below shows two circles and a seg- 
ment AB connecting them. As points A and ? spin around their respective 
circles, what path does point M, the midpoint of segment AB, trace? Dy- 
Geometry, Spherical 
namic geometry makes this investigation simple to perform. The result, 
shown in the lower picture below, is an attractive spiral. 
Other applications of the software display its versatility. Students can 
build a working clock, model planetary motion, create a spinning Ferris 
Wheel, and investigate algebra in a geometric way. 
Since words alone cannot convey the experience of using dynamic geom- 
etry software, students can try programs themselves. Free demonstration 
copies of various software programs are available on the Internet, see also

Geometry, Spherical 
Spherical geometry is the three-dimensional study of geometry on the sur- 
face of a sphere. It is the spherical equivalent of two-dimensional planar 
geometry, the study of geometry on the surface of a plane. A real-life ap- 
proximation of a sphere is the planet Earth—not its interior, but just its sur- 
face. (Earth is more accurately called an "oblate spheroid" because it is 
slightly flattened at the ends of its axis of rotation, the North and South 
Poles.) The surface of a sphere together with its interior points is usually 
referred to as the spherical region; however, spherical geometry generally 
refers only to the surface of a sphere. 
As seen in the figure on the next page, a sphere is a set of points in 
three-dimensional space equidistant from a point ? called the center of the 
sphere. The line segment from point ? (at the center of the sphere) to point 
P (on the surface of the sphere) is called the radius r of the sphere, and the 
radius r extended straight through the sphere's center with ends on opposite 
points of the surface is called the diameter d of the sphere (with a value of 2r;

that is, two times the value of the radius). As an example, the line that con- 
nects the North Pole and the South Pole on Earth is considered a diameter*. 
An infinite line that intersects a sphere at one point only is called a tan- 
gent line. An infinite plane can also intersect a sphere at a single point on 
its surface. When this is the case the plane is also considered tangent to the 
sphere at that point of intersection. For example, if a basketball were lying 
on the floor, the floor would represent a tangent plane because it intersects 
the ball's surface (the sphere) at only one point. 
Great and Small Circles 
The shortest path between two points on a plane is a straight line. How- 
ever, on the surface of a sphere there are no straight lines. Instead, the short- 
est distance between any two points on a sphere is a segment of a circle. To 
see why this is so, consider that a plane can intersect a sphere at more than 
one point. Whenever this is the case, the intersection results in a circle. A 
great circle is defined to be the intersection of a sphere with a plane that 
passes through the center of the sphere. For example, see the circle con- 
taining points ? and D in the illustration below. Similar to a straight line 
on a plane, the shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere 
is the arc of a great circle passing through the two points. 
The size of the circle of intersection will be largest when the plane passes 
through the center of the sphere, as is the case for a great circle. If the plane 
does not contain the center of the sphere, its intersection with the sphere 
is known as a small circle. For example, see the circle containing points A 
and ? in the illustration below. 
Geometry, Spherical 
As a real-world example, assume a cabbage is a sphere, and is cut ex- 
actly in half. The slice goes through the cabbage's center, forming a great 
circle. However, if the slice is off-centered, then the cabbage is cut into two 
unequal pieces, having formed a small circle at the cut. 
Spherical Triangles 
Consider a circle of radius r. A portion of the circle's circumference is re- 
ferred to as an arc length, and is denoted by the letter s. The first illustra- 
tion of this article shows a circle of radius r and arc length s. The angle ? 
is defined as ? = ^. Rearranging this equation in terms of s yields s = Or. 
So the arc length s of a great circle is equal to the radius r of the sphere 
times the angle subtended by that arc length. subtend to extend past 
and mark off a chord or 
Connecting three nonlinear points on a plane by drawing straight lines arc 
using the shortest possible route between the points forms a triangle. By 
analogy, to connect three points on the surface of a sphere using the short- 
est possible route, draw three arcs of great circles to create a spherical tri- 
angle. A triangle drawn on the surface of a sphere is only a spherical triangle 
if it has all of the following properties: 
A) the three sides are all arcs of great circles; 
B) any two sides, summed together, is greater than the third side; 
C) the sum of the three interior angles is greater than 180°, and 
D) each spherical angle is less than 180°. 
In the second illustration of the article, triangle PAB is not a spherical tri- 
angle (because side AB is an arc of a small circle), but triangle PCD is a 
spherical triangle (because side CD is an arc of a great circle). 
The left portion of the figure directly below demonstrates how a spher- 
ical triangle can be formed by three intersecting great circles with arcs of 
length (a,b,c) and vertex angles of (A,B,C).

The right portion of the figure directly above demonstrates that the an- 
gle between two sides of a spherical triangle is defined as the angle between 
the tangents to the two great circle arcs for vertex angle B. 
The above illustration also shows that the arc lengths (a,b,c) and vertex 
angles (A,B,C) of the spherical triangle are related by the following rules for 
spherical triangles.

Spherical Geometry in Navigation 
Spherical geometry can be used for the practical purpose of navigation by 
looking at the measurement of position and distance on the surface of 
Earth. The rotation of Earth defines a coordinate system for the surface 
of Earth. The two points where the rotational axis meets the surface of 
Earth are known as the North Pole and the South Pole, and the great cir- 
cle perpendicular to the rotation axis and lying halfway between the poles 
is known as the equator. Small circles that lie parallel to the equator are 
known as parallels. Great circles that pass through the two poles are known 
as meridians. 
Measuring Latitude and Longitude. The two coordinates of latitude and 
longitude can define any point on the surface of Earth, as is demonstrated 
within the diagram below. Great circles become very important to naviga- 
tion because a segment along a great circle provides the shortest distance 
between two points on a sphere. Therefore, the shortest travel-time can be 
achieved by traveling along a great circle. 
The longitude of a point is measured east or west along the equator, 
and its value is the angular distance between the local meridian passing 
through the point and the Greenwich meridian (which passes through the 
Royal Greenwich Observatory in London, England). Because Earth is ro- 
tating, it is possible to express longitude in time units as well as angular 
units. Earth rotates by 360° in 24 hours. Hence, Earth rotates 15° of lon- 
gitude in 1 hour, and 1° of longitude in 4 minutes. 
The latitude of a point is the angular distance north or south of the 
equator, measured along the meridian, or line of longitude, passing through 
the point. 
Geometry, Spherical 
Measuring Nautical Miles. Distance on the surface of Earth is usually 
measured in nautical miles, where 1 nautical mile (nmi) is defined as the dis- 
tance subtending an angle of 1 minute of arc at the center of Earth. Since 
there are 60 minutes of arc in a degree, there are approximately 60 nauti- 
cal miles in 1 degree of Earth's surface. A speed of 1 nautical mile per hour 
(nmph) is known as 1 knot and is the unit in which the speed of a boat or 
an aircraft is usually measured. 
A Case Study in Measurement. As noted earlier, Earth is not a perfect 
sphere, so the actual measurement of position and distance on the surface 
of Earth is more complicated than described here. But Earth is very nearly 
a true sphere, and for our purposes this demonstration is still valid. 
The terms and concepts that have been developed can be applied to a 
real-world example. Consider a voyage from Washington, D.C. ("W" in di- 
agram below) to Quito, Ecuador ("Q" in diagram below), which is nearly 
on the equator at 0° latitude, 77° West longitude. The latitude and longi- 
tude of Washington, D.C. is about 37° North latitude, 77° West longitude. 
If the entire voyage from Washington, D.C. to Quito (on the equator) is 
along the great circle of longitude 77°, we can use the equation s = Or to 
find the distance s that the airplane travels from Washington D.C. to Quito. 
For this example, ? = 37° (the angle between W and Q). Knowing that 
2 77 radians equals 360° (one complete revolution around a great circle), we 
now convert the angle from degrees to radians: C7°)B7T™^ns) = 0.628 ra- 
dians. Denoting the radius of Earth as r, we use the "arc-length" equation 
developed earlier, that is s = Or, to compute the arc length between Wash- 
ington, D.C. and Quito. 
Placing the values of ? = 0.628 radians and r = 3,443 nautical miles 
(nmi) (the average radius-value for Earth) into the equation yields: s = Or = 
@.628 rad X 3,443 nmi) = 2,163 nmi. Therefore, along the arc of the great 
circle of longitude 77°, from Washington D.C. to Quito, Ecuador, our trip 
covers a distance of 2,163 nmi. see also Triangles; Trigonometry.

Geometry, Tools of 
Plane (or Euclidean) geometry is the branch of mathematics that studies fig- 
ures (such as points, lines, and angles) constructed only with the use of the 
straightedge and the compass. It is primarily concerned with such problems 
as determining the areas and diameters of two-dimensional figures. To de- 
termine geometric designs four important tools of geometry—compass, 
straightedge, protractor, and ruler—are used. Technically a true geometric 
construction with Euclidian tools, originally used by the ancient Greeks, 
uses only a compass or a straightedge. The ruler and protractor were later 
inventions. Today, the study of geometry is an essential part of the train- 
ing of such professionals as mathematicians, engineers, physicists, architects, 
and draftspersons. 
As early as 2000 B.C.E. geometers were concerned with such prob- 
lems as measuring the sizes of fields and irrigation systems, and laying 
out accurate right angles for corners of buildings and monuments. Greek 
mathematician Euclid (c. 300 B.C.E.) and other geometers formalized the 
process of building geometrical figures with the use of specific tools. The 
ancient Greeks introduced construction problems that required a certain 
line or figure to be constructed by the use of the straightedge and com- 
pass alone. Simple examples are the construction of a line that will be 
twice as long as another line, or of a line that will divide a given angle 
into two equal angles. 
Basic Tools 
Straightedge. A straightedge is a geometric tool used to construct 
straight lines. It contains no marks. As the name says, it is a "straight edge." 
A ruler can be used as a straightedge by simply ignoring the measuring 
marks on it. 
Ruler. A ruler is a geometric tool used to measure the length of a line seg- 
ment. A ruler is basically a straightedge with marks usually used for mea- 
suring either inches or centimeters. To use a ruler, place the zero mark on 
the point to begin the measurement. To stop measuring, look at the mark 
on the ruler that lies over the point at which the measurement is to end. 
Geometry, Tools of 
Compass. A compass is a V-shaped tool used to construct circles or arcs 
of circles. (See sketch below on left.) One side of the "V" holds a pencil and 
the other side is a point. The point anchors the compass at one location on 
the paper as the tool is turned so the pencil can trace circles, arcs, and an- 
gles. A compass is adjustable: the setting determines how far away from the 
point the arc would be located. Once the user determines the correct set- 
ting the compass is turned around its anchoring point so that the pencil cre- 
ates a mark, an arc, or a full circle. 
Protractor. A protractor is a geometric tool in the shape of a semicircu- 
lar disk, as shown above on the right. It is used to measure the size of an 
angle in degrees—usually from 0 to 180 degrees. To use a protractor, lay 
the protractor on the angle to be measured. There will be a mark on the 
bottom of the protractor (the straight edge of it) indicating its middle. Place 
this mark over the origin of the angle, and align the straight edge of the 
protractor with one side of the angle. Where the other side of the angle in- 
tersects the protractor there will be a mark with a number next to it. This 
measurement is the measure of the angle. 
Solving Construction Problems 
Construction problems are generally solved by following six steps. 
1. Provide a general statement of the problem that describes what is to 
be constructed. 
2. Draw a figure representing the given parts. 
3. Provide a statement of what is given in step 2. 
4. Provide a specific statement of the result to be obtained. 
5. Develop the construction, with a description (reason) for each step. 
6. Provide a statement proving that the desired result was obtained. 
As an example using a straightedge: Given line segments a and b, con- 
struct the line segment ? = a + 2b. 
Geometry, Tools of 
This example is solved as follows. On working line w, draw a line segment 
equal to the length of line segment a. At the right end of a draw a line seg- 
ment equal to length of line segment b. At the right end of line segment 
a + b, draw a second line segment equal to length of b. The resulting line 
segment is the desired line segment ? = a + b + b = a + 2b. 
As an example of using a compass: Construct an angle equal to the given 
figure ABAC with line segments AB and AC. 
Given: 
Step One: _ _ 
Step Two: _ 
Step Three: _ 
A1 • B1 
-A? 
A1 
4 C' 
Step Four: _ 
This example is solved as follows. In Step One, place the compass pivot 
point at A and adjust the compass width to be between A and B, then con- 
struct an arc that intercepts both line segments AB and AC. Leaving the com- 
pass width unchanged, draw a line w and place the pivot point at an arbitrary 
point A1. Pivot the compass from line w, forming an arc like in Step One (as 
shown in Step Two). The arc's intersection with line w is denoted B'. 
Referring to Step One, now adjust the compass width to equal the dis- 
tance between the arc's intersection with AB and A C. With this width, move 
the compass down to Step Two, place the pivot point at B'; and make an 
arc that intersects with the first arc, as in Step Three. The line segments 
?'? and and A 'B', as shown in Step Four, complete the new angle /?'?'? 
that is equal to the original angle ABAC.

Germain, Sophie 
French Mathematician 
1776-1831 
Sophie Germain is remembered for her work in the theory of numbers and 
in mathematical physics. Germain was born in Paris to a father who was a 
wealthy silk merchant. She educated herself by studying books in her fa- 
ther's library, including the works of Sir Isaac Newton and the writings of 
mathematician Leonhard Euler. 
When the Ecole Polytechnique opened in 1794, even though women 
were not allowed to attend as regular students, Germain obtained lecture 
notes for courses and submitted papers using the pseudonym M. LeBlanc. 
One of the instructors, noted scientist Joseph-Louis Lagrange, became her 
mentor. 
In 1804 Germain began to correspond with German mathematician Carl 
Friedrich Gauss, sending him discoveries she made in number theory. 
Among these was a limited proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, her best known 
contribution to mathematics. This theorem was finally proved in 1994 us- 
ing her approach. Germain also corresponded with mathematician Adrien 
Marie Legendre, who used her suggestions in one of his publications. 
In mathematical physics, Germain is known for her work in acoustics 
and elasticity. She won a prize from the French Academy of Sciences in 
1816 for the development of mathematical models for the vibration of elas- 
tic surfaces. Subsequently, she was invited to attend sessions of the Acad- 
emy of Sciences and the Institut de France, but because she was a woman, 
she could never join either group, see also Euler, Leonhard; Fermat's 
Last Theorem; Newton, Sir Isaac.

Global Positioning System 
Most people have been lost at one time or another, but what if it were pos- 
sible to know where you are, anywhere on Earth, 24 hours a day? The Global 
Positioning System (GPS) can give that information, and it is free to any- 
one with the proper equipment and a basic knowledge of mathematics. 
In the 1980s, the U. S. Department of Defense designed GPS to pro- 
vide the military with accurate, round-the-clock positional information. 
Twenty-seven satellites orbiting over 10,000 miles above Earth regularly 
send information back to Earth. A small piece of equipment, called a GPS 
receiver, uses this information to compute its position to within a few yards. 
GPS receivers used for surveying can find positions to within less than one 
centimeter. 
The "constellation" of satellites above the Earth is constantly changing; 
each orbits Earth twice a day. At any given time there are enough satellite

signals to accurately locate oneself in three dimensions: latitude, longitude, 
and elevation. 
GPS is rapidly becoming a common technology, but it is still a mathe- 
matical wonder. Ancient sailors looked to the heavens to estimate their po- 
sition in the vast oceans. Modern sailors also look to the sky for information, 
but the modern positioning information they receive is so accurate that any 
errors are less than the width of the pencil they use to mark their map. 
Triangulation 
The basic concept of GPS is triangulation. Suppose a person is standing 
in a valley surrounded by several towering mountain peaks. By using a 
compass to measure the direction to each peak, this person could locate 
his or her exact location on a map by using triangulation. After writing 
down the three measurements (remembering that there are 360 degrees 
in a circle), a line should be drawn from each peak in the opposite direc- 
tion just measured. 
Then 180 degrees is added or subtracted so that the direction the lines 
are drawn from each peak will fall between 0 and 360 degrees. For exam- 
ple, if one of the measurements is 270 degrees to peak A, the line from peak 
A back to the person's position would be 90 degrees. The point at which 
the three lines intersect is the point at which the person is standing. 
The GPS satellites are like mountain peaks; they are known points in 
space from which lines can be drawn in order to specify a location. Each 
satellite transmits a radio signal that can be received on Earth and recog- 
nized by a GPS receiver. Rather than measure direction, however, a GPS 
receiver uses the time it takes for each satellite's beacon to reach it and 
calculates a distance. 
Global Positioning System 
Because radio waves travel at the speed of light, the receiver divides the 
time the signal takes to reach the receiver by the speed of light A86,000 
miles per second) and determines the distance. These distances can be used 
to form spheres around the satellites that will intersect at a specific position 
just as the lines drawn from the mountain peaks will intersect at a specific 
position. 
Understanding GPS Measurements 
Assume a GPS receiver is sitting in Nebraska. Once activated it begins to 
collect signals from GPS satellites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The distance to each 
satellite can be determined using the distance formula d = rt (distance, d, 
equals rate, r, multiplied by time, t, or distance equals velocity multiplied 
by time). Although all the satellites are 10,900 miles from the surface of the 
Earth, the distances to each one will vary according to its position in orbit. 
For example, all the street lights in a city may be 15 feet in the air but they 
are not all 15 feet from a specific point in the city. 
The formula for determining these distances may be simple, but the cal- 
culations themselves are anything but simple. The satellites must be pre- 
cisely timed so that each is synchronized with the other satellites in the 
constellation and with base stations on Earth. Although each satellite will 
be at a different distance from a particular point, the time it takes to cover 
those distances at the speed of light does not seem significant. In order to 
calculate distance, however, this time is significant to the GPS receiver. 
Consider that a signal 10,900 miles from a receiver reaches that receiver 
in 0.058602 seconds. A signal 10,926 miles away, however, reaches the re- 
ceiver in 0,0587419 seconds. A 26-mile difference translates into less than 
fourteen one hundred-thousandths @.00014) of a second. Clearly, the GPS 
receiver has some very precise mathematics to work with, further compli- 
cated by the fact that the satellites are always moving. 
After making these complex measurements, the distance to each satel- 
lite will be the hypotenuse of a right triangle created by the receiver's po- 
sition, the satellite's position, and the position on Earth directly under the 
satellite. Once these distances are known, spheres can be created surround- 
ing each satellite. Each sphere has a radius equal to the computed distance 
between the satellite and the receiver. The first sphere, around satellite 1, 
will have an infinite number of points along its surface so the receiver's po- 
sition could fall anywhere on that sphere, including points in outer space. 
Next, the sphere around satellite 2 is introduced, and the two spheres 
create an intersection that forms a circle. Now the GPS receiver could be 
anywhere on that circle, even points in space that, of course, it is not occu- 
pying. The third sphere, around satellite 3, intersects the first two spheres 
and limits the receiver's possible position to two points. The receiver is lo- 
cated at one of the two points. The other point is either in the air above 
the receiver or in the ground directly below the receiver. If the altitude of 
the receiver is known, then it is possible to determine which one of the two 
points is correct. The sphere around satellite number 4 will also reduce the 
two points to only one. It is amazing, yet basically simple, how one receiver 
and four satellites can reduce an infinite number of possible locations to 
only one.

APPLICATIONS OF GPS 
Vehicle tracking is one of the 
fastest-growing GPS applica- 
tions. GPS-equipped fleet vehi- 
cles, public transportation 
systems, delivery trucks, and 
courier services use receivers to 
monitor their locations. Many 
public service units are using 
GPS to determine the police 
car, fire truck, or ambulance 
nearest to an emergency. 
Mapping and surveying com- 
panies use GPS extensively. 
GPS-equipped balloons are mon- 
itoring holes in the ozone layer. 
Buoys tracking major oil spills 
transmit data using GPS. 
These are just a few exam- 
ples. New applications will con- 
tinue to be created as GPS 
technology continues to evolve. 
Simulating GPS. To simulate the process of the Global Positioning 
System all that is needed is some string, scissors, tape, several coins, and 
four stationary points (the corners of a room will work). At any three- 
dimensional point in the room (on a desk, for example) a coin should be 
placed. The end of the string should then be taped into the corner of the 
room, with the other end pulled to the coin, cut, and then placed back in 
the corner. This process is repeated for the remaining three corners, and 
the extra coins are placed elsewhere in the room. 
During this preparation, a volunteer waits outside the room. The vol- 
unteer should then enter the room and be alerted to the availability of the 
strings. The volunteer can then start pulling the cut ends of the string out- 
ward from the corners beginning with any two. By adding the third and 
fourth strings and finding where they all intersect, the volunteer should be 
able to eliminate all the extra coins and find the original coin. This is how 
GPS works in its most basic form. 
Advantages and Disadvantages of GPS 
Atmospheric inconsistencies can create inaccuracies in the positions com- 
puted by a GPS. Additionally, GPS is a "line of sight" system. Although a 
user cannot actually see the satellites in space, he or she does need an un- 
obstructed view of the sky in order to utilize GPS. This poses serious chal- 
lenges to those who choose to use GPS in canyons, cities, or other situations 
where large, solid objects mask out portions of the sky. When working where 
obstructions exist, careful planning must be done to ensure enough satel- 
lites are in "in view" for proper positioning. 
Fortunately, GPS has a built-in feature, the almanac, to aid in identify- 
ing the location of satellites. Each satellite "knows" the location and direc- 
tion of every other satellite. Along with the signal used to provide positions, 
satellites also transmit the almanac to a GPS receiver. Common GPS plan- 
ning software can use the almanac to plot the entire constellation of satel- 
lites so users can plan ahead for their needs. 
For example, if one needed to work in a canyon, planning software may 
indicate the only feasible time would be from noon until 2:00 P.M. Only 
during that time will the receiver have an unobstructed path to a sufficient 
number of satellites, all very high above the horizon, from within the 
canyon, see also Flight, Measurements of; Maps and Mapmaking; Nav- 
igation.

Golden Section 
To understand what constitutes a golden section, consider the top line seg- 
ment shown on the next page. The line segment has three of its points 
marked. Point P partitions the line segment AB into two smaller segments: 
Golden Section 
from left endpoint A to point P {AP), and from P to right endpoint ? {PB). 
The line segments AP and PB are also shown individually. 
A "golden ratio" can now be formed as the ratio of one line segment to 
another line segment. Point P divides the entire line segment AB into a 
golden section if the following equation is valid: 
AP/AB = PB/AP. 
In other words, the length of line segment AP divided by the length of the 
entire line segment AB is a ratio, or number, and that number is the same 
as the ratio of the shortest line segment PB and the segment AP. It turns out 
that these ratios are equal to the irrational number 0.61803. . .; that is: 
AP/AB = PB/AP = 0.61803 . . . 
Note that the decimal places continue indefinitely. The number 0.61803.. .is 
called the golden ratio or golden number, whereas the term "golden sec- 
tion" refers to the line segments formed by a point, such as P, whose re- 
sulting ratio is the golden number. 
Significance of the Golden Ratio 
The golden section and the golden ratio are important to mathematics, art, 
and architecture. The construction of the golden section goes back at least 
as far as the ancient Greeks, to the Pythagoreans (ca. 550 B.C.E.-300 B.C.E.). 
The Pythagoreans believed that numbers were the basis of nature and man, 
and therefore number relationships like the golden ratio were of utmost im- 
portance. 
Besides line segments, the golden ratio also appears in many geometric 
figures. For example, a rectangle is said to be in golden section if its width 
and length are in the golden ratio (that is, if the width divided by the length 
equals 0.61803. . .). 
Some scholars believe that various temples of the ancient Greeks, like 
the Parthenon in Athens, were purposefully produced with various dimen- 
sions in the golden ratio. Many of the artists and architects of the Renais- 
sance period are believed to have incorporated the golden ratio into their 
paintings, sculptures, and monuments. A prime example is Leonardo da 
Vinci A452-1519), who extensively used golden ratios (or their approxima- 
tions) in his paintings. In Leonardo's famous drawing "Vitruvian Man," the 
distance ratio from the top of the head to navel, and from the navel to the 
soles of his feet approximates the golden ratio. 
Many people feel that geometric forms and figures incorporating the 
golden ratio are more beautiful than other forms. Psychological studies pur- 
irrational number a real 
number that cannot be 
written as a fraction of 
the form a/b, where a 
and b are both integers 
and b is not 0 
ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION 
OF GOLDEN SECTION 
Some dictionaries and text- 
books define golden section 
(and number) as the inverse of 
the definition shown in this arti- 
cle. The formula then becomes 
(again referring to line segment 
AB) AB/AP = AP/PB = 1.61803 
Sometimes the larger value is 
denoted by the Greek letter "Phi" 
(i.e., Phi = 1.61803. . .) while 
the smaller value of the golden 
number is denoted by a "small" 
phi (i.e., phi = 0.61803. . .). 
Note that Phi = 1 + phi.

Grades, Highway 
WHAT DEFINES A 
HIGHWAY? 
A highway is a road with a hard 
surface, such as asphalt or con- 
crete, that is open for the gen- 
eral public to drive upon. 
Highways connect towns, cities 
and industrial areas to one 
another. Most highways follow 
the "lay of the land." In other 
words, highways must rise and 
fall as hills and valleys are 
encountered. 
The term "grade" is used in several different ways with respect to roads and 
highways. The "sub-grade" lies beneath a roadway and is used as a sup- 
porting base. "Grading" a road means to smooth out the roadbed with earth- 
moving equipment during the construction phase. In this article, the grade 
of a road is defined as a measure of the road's steepness as it rises and falls 
along its route. In other words, it is the magnitude of its incline or slope. 
The grade of a highway is a measure of its incline or slope. The amount 
of grade indicates how much the highway is inclined from the horizontal. 
For example, if a section of road is perfectly flat and level, then its grade 
along that section is zero. However, if the section is very steep, then the 
grade along that section will be expressed as a number, usually a percent- 
age, such as 10 percent. 
The illustration below shows a highway in profile (from the side). No- 
tice that a right triangle has been constructed in the diagram. The eleva- 
tion, or height, of the highway increases in the sketch when moving from 
left to right. The bottom of the triangle is the horizontal distance this sec- 
tion of highway covers. This horizontal distance, sometimes called the "run" 
of the highway, indicates how far a vehicle would travel on the road if it 
were level. However, it is apparent that the road is not level but rises from 
left to right. This "rise" is a measure of how much higher a vehicle is after 
driving from left to right along the road. 
run 
A000) 
Cartesian coordinate 
system a way of mea- 
suring the positions of 
points in a plane using 
two perpendicular lines 
as axes 
To calculate the grade of a section of highway, divide the rise (height 
increase) by the run (horizontal distance). This equation, used to calculate 
the ratio of rise-to-run for highway grades, is the same ratio as the slope 
"y/x" encountered in a Cartesian coordinate system. In the example 
above, the rise of the highway section is 100 feet, while the run is 1,000 
feet. The resulting grade is thus 100 feet divided by 1,000 feet, or 0.1. 
Highway grades are usually expressed as a percentage. Any number rep- 
resented in decimal form can be converted to a percentage by multiplying 
Graphs 
that number by 100. Consequently, a highway grade of 0.1 is referred to as 
a 0 percent grade" because 0.1 times 100 equals 10 percent. The highway 
grade for a section of highway that has a rise of 1 kilometer and a run of 8 
kilometers is g-, or 0.125. To convert the highway grade into a percentage, 
multiply 0.125 by 100, which results in a grade of 12.5 percent. 
Applications of Grade 
When a new highway or road is being planned, its grade over its various 
sections is one of the key aspects that must be determined in advance. The 
grade of the road is very important for the safety of the motorists who will 
be using it. Most of us have experienced how a rolling bicycle has a ten- 
dency to pick up speed as it goes downhill, and how when going uphill the 
bicycle will slow down unless the cyclist pedals harder. The same situation 
must be considered when constructing modern highways. 
If a grade is too steep, vehicle operators must use excessive braking when 
going downhill. In contrast, vehicle operators going uphill will have to slow 
down severely, possibly affecting traffic flow adversely. Grades are of great 
concern for vehicles carrying or pulling heavy loads, like semi-tractor trail- 
ers, or a family car pulling a camper or boat. To avoid these problems the 
highway engineers who plan and design highways pay close attention to road 
grades, and design into the highway's construction smaller grades rather 
than larger ones. 
The concept of highway grades can also be applied to other types of 
pathways that are used by people or vehicles. For instance, residential roads 
are constructed to have a slight grade from the curb to the center of the 
road. A grade of 1 percent is considered the minimum required for proper 
drainage during a rainstorm. For a run of 10 feet, a 1 percent grade means 
one-tenth of a foot rise from the curb to the middle of the road. 
Another situation where grade is an important consideration is in the 
construction of ramps for the disabled. Wheelchair ramps must have a fairly 
low grade, because if a ramp is too steep, people may be unable to use it. 
Nationwide, a generally accepted maximum grade for wheelchair ramps is 
8.3 percent, or a ratio of 1:12. see also Fraction; Percent; Slope.

Graphs 
A graph is a pictorial representation of the relationship between two quan- 
tities. A graph can be anything from a simple bar graph that displays the 
Graphs 
measurements of various objects to a more complicated graph of functions 
in two or three dimensions. The former shows the relationship between the 
kind of object and its quantity; the latter shows the relationship between in- 
put and output. Graphing is a way to make information easier for a viewer 
to absorb. 
Types of Graphs 
The simplest graphs show the number of many objects. For example, a bar 
graph might name the months of the year along a horizontal axis and show 
numbers (for the number of days in each month) along a vertical axis. Then 
a rectangle (or bar) is drawn above each month. The height of the bar might 
indicate the number of days in that month on which it rained, or on which 
a person exercised, or on which the temperature rose above 90 degrees. See 
the generic example of a bar graph below (top right). 
Another simple kind of graph is a circle graph or pie graph, which shows 
fractions or percentages. In this kind of graph, a circle is divided into pie- 
shaped sectors. Each sector is given a label and indicates the fraction of the 
total area that goes with that label. See the generic example of a pie graph 
below (top middle). 
A pie chart might be used to display the percentages of a budget that 
are allotted to various expenditures. If the sector labeled "medical bills" takes 
up two-tenths of the area of the circle, that means that two-tenths, or 20 
percent, of the budget is devoted to medical expenses. Usually the percent- 
ages are written on the sectors along with their labels to make the graph 
easier to read. In both bar graphs and pie graphs, the reader can immedi- 
ately pick out the largest and smallest categories without having to search 
through a chart or list, making it easy to compare the relative sizes of many 
objects simultaneously.

Often the two quantities being graphed can both be represented nu- 
merically. For example, student scores on examinations are often plotted on 
a graph, especially if there are many students taking the exam. In such a 
graph, the numbers on the horizontal axis represent the possible scores on 
Graphs 
the exam, and the numbers on the vertical axis represent numbers of stu- 
dents who earned that score. The information could be plotted as a simple 
bar graph. If only the top point of each bar is plotted and a curve is drawn 
to connect these points, the result is a line graph. See the generic example 
of a line graph on the pevious page (top left). Although the points on the 
line between the plotted points do not correspond to any pieces of infor- 
mation, a smooth line can be easier to understand than a large collection of 
bars or dots. 
Graphs for Continuous Data 
Graphs become slightly more complicated when one (or both) of the quan- 
tities in the graph can have continuous values rather than a discrete set. A 
common example of this is a quantity that changes over time. For example, 
a scientist might be observing the rate of growth of bacteria. The rates could 
be plotted so that the horizontal axis displays units of time and the vertical 
axis displays numbers (how many bacteria exist). 
Then, for instance, the point C,1000) would mean that at "time 3" 
(which could mean three o'clock, or three seconds after starting, or vari- 
ous other times, depending on the units being used and the starting point 
of the experiment) there were one thousand bacteria in the sample. The 
rise and fall of the graph show the increases and decreases in the number 
of bacteria. 
In this case, even though only a finite set of points represent actual data, 
the remaining points do have a natural interpretation. For instance, suppose 
that in addition to the point C,1000), the graph also contains the point 
D,1500) and that both of these points correspond to actual measurements. 
If the scientist joins all of the points on the graph by a line, then the point 
C.5,1200) might lie on the graph, or perhaps the point C.5,1350). 
There are many different lines that can be drawn through a collection 
of points. Looking at the overall shape of the data points helps the scientist 
decide which line is the most reasonable fit. In the previous example, the 
scientist could estimate that at time 3.5, there were 1200 (or 1350) bacteria 
in the sample. Thus graphing can be helpful in making estimates and pre- 
dictions. 
Graphs for Predictions 
Sometimes the purpose for drawing a graph may not be to view the data al- 
ready known but to construct a mathematical model that will allow one to 
analyze data and make predictions. One of the simplest models that can be 
constructed from a set of data is called a best-fit line. Such a line is useful 
in situations in which the data are roughly linear—that is, they are increas- 
ing or decreasing at a roughly constant rate but do not fall precisely on a 
line. (See graph on the previous page, bottom right.) 
A best-fit line can be a very useful tool for analyzing data because lines 
have very simple formulas describing their behavior. If, for instance, one 
has collected data up to time 5 and wishes to predict what the value will 
be at time 15, the value 15 can be inserted into the formula for the line to 
derive an estimation. One can also determine how good an estimate is likely 
to be by computing the correlation factor for the data. The correlation 
discrete composed of 
distinct elements 
correlation the process 
of establishing a mutual 
or reciprocal relation 
between two things or 
sets of things 
Graphs 
factor is a quantity that measures how close the set of data is to being lin- 
ear; that is, how good a "fit" the best-fit line actually is. 
Graphs for Functions 
One of the most common uses of graphs is to display the information en- 
coded in a function. A function, informally speaking, is an operation or rule 
that can be applied to numbers. Functions are usually graphed in the carte- 
sian plane (that is, the x,j'-plane) with the horizontal or x-axis representing 
the input variable and the vertical or j/-axis representing the output variable. 
The graph of a function differs from the other types of graphs described so 
far in that all the points on the graph represent actual information. A con- 
crete relationship, usually given by a mathematical formula, connects the 
two objects being analyzed. 
For example, the "squaring" function takes numbers and squares them. 
Thus an input of the number 1 corresponds to an output of 1; an input of 
2 corresponds to an output of 4; an input of —7 corresponds to an output 
of 49; and so on. Therefore, the graph of this function contains the points 
A, 1), B, 4), (-7, 49), and infinitely many others. 
Does the point A0, 78) lie on this graph? To determine the answer, ex- 
amine which characteristics all the points on the graph have in common. 
Any point on the graph of a function represents an input-output pair, with 
the x-coordinate representing input and the j/-coordinate representing out- 
put. With the squaring function, each output value is the square of the cor- 
responding input value, so on the graph of the squaring function, each 
j/-coordinate must be the square of the corresponding x-coordinate. Because 
78 is not the square of 10, the point A0, 78) does not lie on the graph of 
the squaring function. 
Graphing Notation 
It is traditional to name graphs with an equation rather than with words. 
The equation of any graph, regardless of whether it is the graph of a func- 
tion, is meant to be a perfect description of the graph—it should tell the 
viewer the relationship between the x- and ^-coordinates of the numbers 
being graphed. 
For example, the equation of the graph of the squaring function is ? = 
x2 because the j/-coordinate of any point on the graph is the square of the 
x-coordinate. The line that passes through the point @, 3) and slants up- 
wards with slope 4 (that is, at a rate of four units up for every one unit to 
the right) has equation ? = 4r + 3. This indicates that for every point on 
the graph, the j/-coordinate is 3 more than 4 times the x-coordinate. 
An equation of a graph has many uses: it is not only a description of 
the graph but also a mechanism for finding points on the graph and a test 
for determining whether a given point lies on the graph. For example, to 
find out whether the point B78, 3254) lies on the line ? = 4r + 3, sim- 
ply insert B78, 3254), resulting in the inequality 3254 ^ 4B78) + 3. Be- 
cause these numbers are not equal, the point does not lie on the line. 
However, the equation shows that the point B78, 1115) does lie on the

Graphs and Effects of Parameter 
Changes 
The two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system may be used to graph 
a variety of equations in the form of straight and curved lines. One way to 
graph an equation is to determine a number of different values for the vari- 
ables and plot them on the graph. It can be helpful, however, to understand 
how a change in the parameters of an equation affects the resulting line. 
Graphs of Straight Lines 
The graph of the simple equation ? = lx, or ? = x, is graphed in (a) below. 
The line passes through every coordinate point where x = y, such as B, 2) 
or (-3, -3). 
Notice what happens to the graph of the equation when the parameters 
of the equation are changed by using a different coefficient for x, such as 
? = 3x. As part (a) shows, the new line has a steeper slope. If the coefficient 
is further increased, the slope will become even steeper, and the line will 
become closer to vertical.

dent variables which

an expression as two 
separate functions 
Conversely, if the coefficient for x is decreased, a different change in 
the line occurs. As part (b) above shows, the line for ? = -^ has a more grad- 
ual slope than the line for ? = ?. If the coefficient were to be farther de- 
creased, the line would become flatter, and it would appear more like a 
horizontal line. 
Graphs and Effects of Parameter Changes 
If the coefficient is a negative number, an interesting line results. For 
instance, the graph of the equation ? = — ?? is shown in part (b) above. 
Comparing this line with the graph for ? = ?? shows that the graph of ? = 
— ?? moves down from the left to right (a negative direction) and the graph 
of ? = ?? moves up from left to right (a positive direction). These two lines 
therefore are described as having a negative and a positive slope, respec- 
tively. From this example, it can be seen that the coefficient of x in the equa- 
tion of a line indicates the slope of the line. 
Lines Not Passing through the Origin. All of the lines described above 
pass through the origin @, 0), but many lines do not. The line for the 
equation ? = ?? + 2 will pass above the origin, as shown in part (a) be- 
low. The line has the same slope as ? = ???, but has been shifted two units 
up the j/-axis. The two lines are thus parallel because they have the same 
slope. 
The equation ? = ?? — 2, also graphed in (a), passes through the j/-axis 
at —2. The slope of the line is 3, which is the same the slope for ? = ??. 
But compared toy = ??, the line for ? = ?? — 2 has been shifted two units 
down the j/-axis. 
(a) 
Understanding the role of the coefficient of x in indicating the slope, 
and the role of the constant in indicating the point where the line will in- 
tersect the j/-axis, can make it easier to graph an equation. The equation 
? = 2x + 4 will pass through the j/-axis at 4 and has a slope of 2, as shown 
in part (b) above. 
The equation ? = 2x + 4 may be expressed in different forms. For ex- 
ample, x = -j ? — 2. The form ? = 2x + 4, written in general terms as 
? = mx + b, is called the slope intercept form. In this form, the coefficient 
m is the slope, and the constant b indicates where the line intersects the y- 
axis. The intersection point is called the j/-intercept. The graph of the equa- 
tion ? = 3x — 4 has a slope of 3 and intersects the j/-axis at —4. 
Graphs of Curved Lines 
Changes in the parameters of higher-degree equations (that is, higher 
than first-degree) will result in patterns of changes in their graphs simi- 
lar to those for straight lines. For example, the graph of ? = x2, as shown 
in part (a) below, is a curve known as a parabola. The coefficient indi- 
Graphs and Effects of Parameter Changes 
cates whether the parabola opens facing up or facing down, and whether 
it is narrow or broad. 
Changing the coefficient of x2 to a negative value results in a parabola 
that is a mirror-image of the parabola for ? = x2. The parabola for ? = x2 
opens upward, and the parabola for ? = —x2 opens downward. 
If the coefficient of x2 is changed so the equation is ? = ??2, notice 
the changes to the graph of the equation, as depicted in part (b) below. 
The parabola still passes through the origin, but it is narrower than ? = 
x2. If the coefficient of the graph were increased even more, then the 
parabola would become even narrower. Conversely, if the coefficient of 
the original equation were decreased, the resulting parabola would still 
pass through the origin, but would become broader, as depicted in (b) be- 
low as ? = ? ?2. 
Compare the parabola in (b) below for ? = ??2 to the parabola for 
? = — 3x2. As with the equations ? = x2 and ? = —x2, one parabola is the 
mirror image of the other. The two parabolas open in opposite direc- 
tions. 
'¦S* 
Curves Not Passing through the Origin. Changing a parameter of the 
equation ? = x2 to ? = x2 + 2 will change the point at which the parabola 
crosses the j/-axis. In this case, the parabola does not pass through the ori- 
gin, but passes through the j/-axis at 2, as shown below. The parabola has 
been shifted two units up the j/-axis. Similarly, the parabola of ? = x2 — 5 
is shifted 5 units down the j/-axis, and passes through the j/-axis at —5. 
Graphs and Effects of Parameter Changes 
In the general equation for a parabola, ? = ax2 + b, the coefficient a in- 
dicates the shape of the parabola and in which direction the parabola opens, 
upward or downward. The value of b indicates where the parabola intersects 
the j/-axis. 
More complex equations and their graphs will also show patterns that 
result from changes in the parameters of the equations. Knowing how 
changes in the various parameters of an equation affect the graph of the 
equation is helpful for drawing, interpreting, and applying equations and 
their graphs, see also Graphs.

Heating and Air Conditioning 
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, heating a home was a 
matter of tossing another log or more coal into the fireplace or stove. "Air 
conditioning" was the shade of a backyard tree. Twenty-first century homes 
use far more sophisticated technological tools—tools that a homeowner is 
likely to take for granted. 
A heating and air conditioning contractor has to be as much of a sci- 
entist as a builder or technician. The course requirements of typical heat- 
ing and air conditioning programs at community or junior colleges place a 
heavy emphasis on chemistry, physics, engineering, and mathematics, in- 
cluding geometry and algebra. Good heating and air conditioning con- 
tractors are able to compute formulas and equations in order to arrive at 
volumes, pressures, and degrees. They must be able to accurately measure 
distances, angles, circles, arcs, temperatures, weights, and volumes. They 
also must identify and interpret geometric figures, graphs, scales, and gauge 
indications. Further, they must know the scientific principles that are cen- 
tral to their work, including heat transfer, combustion, temperature, pres- 
sure, electricity, and magnetism. They should also know the physical and 
chemical properties of commonly used substances such as refrigerants and 
hydrocarbons. 
The Science of Cooling 
The science of cooling is rooted in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, 
which states that heat only flows from higher to lower temperature levels, 
and never the other way around. Using this law, physicists can explain ex- 
actly how an air conditioner (or a refrigerator, which uses the same process) 
works. They can also use related principles, such as those of exergy and an- 
ergy, to design better, more efficient cooling systems. 
How does a typical air conditioner work? It lowers the temperature by 
continuous extraction of heat energy using a thermodynamic cycle. The 
most common of these cycles is called the vapor-compression refrigeration 
cycle, sometimes called the Rankine cycle. In this cycle, a substance known 
as the "working fluid," or refrigerant, goes through cyclical changes of state 
in a closed loop. This loop is made up of four parts: an evaporator, a com- 
pressor, a condenser, and a throttle valve. The evaporator is installed in the 
space to be cooled while the other parts are installed outside of the space.

Before it enters the evaporator, the working fluid is a liquid or liquid- 
vapor mixture. Its pressure is low, and its temperature is below that of the 
space to be cooled, also called the "cold room." In the evaporator, the fluid 
takes up heat from the cold room because of the temperature difference. 
The fluid-vapor is then brought from low to high pressure in the compres- 
sor, which increases its temperature. In a well-designed system, the tem- 
perature of the fluid-vapor leaving the compressor should be above that of 
the surroundings, providing the temperature difference necessary for re- 
moving heat from the fluid to the surroundings. This occurs in the con- 
denser, where the fluid undergoes a phase change from vapor to liquid 
because heat has been removed. The loop is closed by the throttle valve, 
where the fluid is expanded from the high condenser pressure to the low 
evaporator pressure. 
One issue that scientists struggle with is finding a good working fluid. 
Water would be, at first glance, the ideal fluid because it is inexpensive and 
safe. Its thermodynamic properties, though, prevent it from being the best 
choice. Water vapor has a very low density, so using it would require huge 
piping volumes and a lot of work on the part of the compressor. Chloro- 
fluorocarbons (CFCs) work better, but unfortunately they contribute to 
ozone depletion in the stratosphere. In large industrial refrigeration plants, 
ammonia (NH3) is the most common choice. 
Contractors who install air-conditioning systems are probably not think- 
ing about the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. They are, however, 
thinking about what size air conditioner is needed to keep you comfortable 
on hot summer days. Factors that must be measured and taken into account 
in deciding on the size of an air-conditioning system are: 
• the geographical location, and therefore average temperatures dur- 
ing the cooling season; 
• the length of walls in the rooms, including walls not exposed to direct 
sunlight, those that are exposed to direct sunlight, and interior walls; 
• the type of wall frame construction (framing, masonry, etc.); 
• the ceiling height; 
• the ceiling area, and the presence and amount of insulation above the 
ceiling; 
• the space's floor area; 
• the width of doors and arches; 
• the window area, the orientation of the windows (north, south, etc.), 
and the type of glass (single-pane, double-pane, block); 
• the number of people who normally occupy the room (giving off body 
heat); 
• the amount of heat given off by lights and appliances; and 
• the hours of operation. 
Taken together, these factors determine the cooling capacity that is needed, 
usually measured in British thermal units (BTUs); one BTU is the amount 
of energy needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water one degree 
Fahrenheit. 
Hollerith, Herman 
The Science of Heating 
In many respects the science of heating a home is much simpler than cool- 
ing: Unless you have solar heat or a windmill, something somewhere gets 
burned, and the heat is transferred into your living space either directly (as 
is in the case of natural gas, propane, or heating oil) or indirectly (as in the 
case of electricity). When a furnace runs, it ignites the fuel with burners that 
heat up the heat exchanger. A blower moves air across the heat exchanger, 
and the warm air is then circulated through the living area by a duct sys- 
tem. Fumes from the burned fuel are expelled through a flue (a pipe de- 
signed to remove exhaust gases from a fireplace, stove, or burner). 
To determine how big a furnace needs to be, the same information listed 
for air conditioning is necessary. The result of these calculations is what a 
heating contractor calls a "heat load," which is measured in BTUs. For ex- 
ample, a contractor might determine that a house's heat load is 61,000 BTUs 
and that an 80,000 BTU furnace running at 80 percent efficiency, provid- 
ing 64,000 BTUs, is a good approximate fit. A problem with a higher effi- 
ciency furnace is that it can often "short cycle," meaning that it will turn 
off before all the cold air in the home has cycled through the furnace. 
The simplest type of furnace is called a "single-stage" furnace. This 
means that the furnace is either on or off and the fan blower is adjusted to 
a single setting that provides the optimum amount of heat based on the 
home's heat load. Most furnaces, however, are "two-stage" furnaces, and 
these provide more comfort and typically a higher efficiency. 
When a two-stage thermostat senses that a room is cold and sends an 
electrical signal to the furnace to run, the furnace operates at two-thirds 
strength. If after a set amount of time the thermostat is still calling for heat, 
the furnace switches to 100 percent capacity. This gives the furnace's blow- 
ers time to circulate warm air throughout the house. If the furnace oper- 
ated at 100 percent right away, it might circulate enough hot air to satisfy 
the thermostat but not enough to warm colder pockets in other areas of the 
house.

FUZZY LOGIC AND 
THERMOSTATS 
Early generations of electronic 
controls, including the ther- 
mostats on furnaces and air 
conditioners, were always either 
on or off. Today's controls are 
computerized, thereby enabling 
them to use "fuzzy logic," or a 
computer's ability to "learn" 
and "think" in shades of gray 
rather than black-and-white. 
Thus, instead of turning on a 
furnace all the way when the 
temperature in a building falls 
to a certain point, a fuzzy logic 
thermostat turns the heat on 
just a little as the temperature 
approaches a specific setting. 
This feature helps maintain the 
temperature at a steady, con- 
stant value and avoids cycles of 
chilliness followed by blasts of 
hot air.

mation technology that 
uses discrete values of 
a physical quantity to 
transmit information 
including, but not limited to, error and bias. Herman Hollerith's invention 
of a tabulating machine was the first attempt to solve these problems. 
During the 1880 U.S. census, the logistical problems of gathering and 
tabulating great amounts of data quickly enough for the data to remain use- 
ful was first recognized. In fact, the data from the 1880 census took nearly 
seven years to tabulate, far too long for the results to accurately reflect sta- 
tistics that were needed for determining seats in the U.S. House of Repre- 
sentatives. The U.S. Census Bureau devised a competition in which a prize 
would be awarded for the best method of tabulating census data. 
Herman Hollerith, a former statistician for the U.S. Census Bureau and 
professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology, won the competition. His work had led him to an interest in the 
mechanical manipulation of data. It seemed to lend itself perfectly to being 
automated. He edged out two competitors who invented "chip" and "slip" 
systems with his "card" system. His tabulating machine was put to use in 
the very next census in 1890. 
Hollerith's "integrating machine" punched holes into stiff paper cards 
similar to the ones he had seen conductors using on trains. By punching 
holes next to the appropriate descriptors on the card, such as "large nose" 
or "dark hair," the conductor could create a profile of each passenger. Hol- 
lerith designed his cards to be the same size as dollar bills so that storage 
cabinets for currency could also be used for the "Hollerith cards." 
Hollerith's system was essentially a binary system. "Punched" and "not 
punched" corresponded to the Is and 0s we are familiar with in the twenty- 
first century's digital data storage systems. The cards were run under a group 
of brushes that completed electrical circuits when a "punch" was encoun- 
tered. A corresponding mechanical counter then advanced for each punch, 
and in this way counted the total. 
The Hollerith tabulating device allowed the 1890 census to be com- 
pleted in only six weeks and at a savings of $5 million, an almost unbeliev- 
able improvement. In addition, data could be sorted and organized based 
on selected characteristics with little additional effort. More data than ever 
before could be collected and analyzed. 
Fueled by the success of his machine, Herman formed the Herman Hol- 
lerith Tabulating Machine Company in 1896. However, his machine was so 
expensive the Census Bureau developed their own system for the 1910 cen- 
sus. Competition forced Hollerith to merge with another company, and the 
Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company was created in 1911. Thomas 
J. Watson later reorganized it into International Business Machines (IBM) 
Corporation. The success of Hollerith's machine was the basis of IBM's suc- 
cess and has led him to be remembered as a founder of information pro- 
cessing, see also Mathematical Devices, Mechanical; Census.

Hopper, Grace 
American Mathematician and Computer Programming Pioneer 
1906-1992 
American mathematician and computer pioneer Grace Murray Hopper was 
called "Amazing Grace" by coworkers because of her determined ways. Born 
to parents who believed in quality education, Hopper was fascinated with 
gadgets, and she disassembled clocks and built vehicles with her "Struct- 
iron" kit. She was strongly influenced by her parents, and described her 
mother as having a "very great interest in mathematics" and her father as 
having "a house full of books, constant interest in reading, and insatiable 
curiosity." 
Hopper entered Vassar in 1924 to study mathematics and physics and 
graduated with a bachelor's degree. She performed mathematics research at 
Yale and earned her master's degree in 1930 and her doctorate degree in 
1934. During this era, these were rare achievements, especially for a woman. 
Grace Hopper is best 
known for her contribution 
to the design and devel- 
opment of the COBOL 
programming language for 
business applications. 
She is shown here work- 
ing on an early form of 
computer.

HOW DID COMPUTERS 
GET "BUGS?" 
Grace Hopper was at Harvard 
University in 1945 when, while 
working on the Mark-ll, she dis- 
covered a hardware failure 
caused by a trapped moth. She 
coined the now common term 
"bug" to refer to unexpected 
computer failures.

Hopper taught mathematics at Vassar and continued her tenure there 
as a professor until 1943. Her unusual methods applied mathematics to real 
life. She required her probability students to play dice and instructed stu- 
dents to plan a city by managing expenses. 
Hopper's great-grandfather, a Navy rear-admiral, was her personal hero. 
When the United States entered World War II in 1941, she was crestfallen 
when the U.S. Navy would not accept women. By 1943 a shortage of men 
allowed women to enter the ranks. Hopper eagerly joined, but was rejected 
because she was too old, did not weigh enough, and was considered essen- 
tial to the war effort as a civilian professor of mathematics. Undaunted, Hop- 
per convinced the Navy to accept her, and in 1943, she started officer 
training, graduating at the top of her class. Assigned to Harvard's Compu- 
tation Project, she worked with Howard Aiken on the Mark-I, which is con- 
sidered one of the first programmable digital computers.

In 1946 Hopper ended her Navy duty but remained a reservist and was ap- 
pointed a Harvard research fellow and continued work on the Mark-II and 
Mark-Ill computers. Even though colleagues said only scientists had enough 
knowledge to use computers, Hopper was undaunted and continued to write 
programs that made computers easily accessible. 
In 1949 Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation as a senior 
mathematician where she worked on UNIVAC (UNIVersal Automatic 
Computer), the first computer to handle both numeric and textual infor- 
mation. Her original staff was comprised of four men and four women. Hop- 
per liked hiring women, she said, because "Women turn out to be very good 
programmers for one very good reason. They tend to finish up things, and 
men don't very often finish." 
During this time, Hopper designed an improved compiler that trans- 
lated instructions from English commands to machine language. This re- 
duced the need for writing tedious machine code. She finished the A-O 
compiler in 1952 using easy terms like SUB (for subtraction) and MPY (for 
multiplication). 
In 1957 Hopper developed FLOW-MATIC, the first commercial, data- 
processing compiler that allowed computers to be used for automated billing 
and payroll calculation. FLOW-MATIC became the foundation for Hop- 
per's next development in 1959, the computer language COmmon Business 
Oriented Language, or COBOL. Whereas IBM's FORTRAN programming 
language used a highly condensed, mathematical code, COBOL used com- 
mon English language words. COBOL was written for use on different com- 
puters and was intended to be independent of any one computer company. 
For her wide-reaching influence on COBOL's development, Hopper was 
deemed the "grandmother of COBOL." 
Later Honors 
Hopper retired from the Navy in 1966 but was recalled to help standardize 
computer languages. In 1969 she was named the first computer science "Man 
of the Year" by the Data Processing Management Association and was 
known among coworkers as "the little old lady who talks to computers." 
Human Body 
Her office contained a skull-and-crossbones flag and a clock that ran back- 
ward to remind people to use flexible thinking. 
Grace Hopper retired in 1986 as the oldest Naval officer on active duty. 
In 1991 President George Bush awarded Rear-Admiral Hopper the National 
Medal of Technology, saying she was the first woman to receive America's 
highest technology award as an individual, and recognizing her "as a com- 
puter pioneer, who spent a half century helping keep America on the lead- 
ing edge of high technology." Throughout her life, Hopper held to her 
belief that "Most problems have more than one solution." see also Com- 
puters, Evolution of Electronic.

Human Body 
Humans come in different shapes and sizes. There is no shape or size that 
is considered "right." Medical professionals have created healthy guidelines 
for people. When a baby is born, doctors track many variables to make sure 
it is developing correctly. These charts and guidelines are not perfect, but 
they form a framework from which to assess a person's health. 
Tracking Growth 
Over the years, physicians have developed various methods for tracking 
growth. Keeping a record of a child's growth patterns helps doctors deter- 
mine if the child is developing properly. As a person ages, doctors continue 
to monitor growth, helping patients maintain a healthy weight. Physicians 
also review height to check for problems of the spine, bone, and other med- 
ical conditions. 
Growth Charts. Pediatric growth charts have been used by medical pro- 
fessionals since 1977. The charts are used for many measurements of growth 
in a child. For example, when a child's height is measured, she is then placed 
into a percentile. If a child is in the seventy-fifth percentile in height, it 
means that she would be taller than 75 percent of all other children in her 
age group. 
Originally, the sampling for growth charts was taken from a small por- 
tion of the population. These children were primarily Caucasian, formula- 
fed, and middle-class. This sample was problematic because it did not reflect 
the diversity of the United States. To help make charts that were repre- 
sentative of the whole, and in turn were more accurate, samples were taken

from a much larger portion of the population and from people with vary- 
ing backgrounds. 
There are various mathematical concepts behind growth charts. Scal- 
ing is one important factor in charting growth in an infant. Though often 
associated with architecture, humans also undergo scaling. While an infant 
is much smaller than an adult, the support material remains the same: bone. 
Bone is a type of tissue that can only support a limited degree of force due 
to strain. This is evident in the number of broken bones humans can expe- 
rience when faced with too much strain—for instance, as a result of activi- 
ties such as sports. As humans grow, their bones also grow but only with a 
narrow tolerance for strain. 
"Average" Height. The determination of "average" human dimensions is 
based on statistics and illustrates the statistical concepts of sampling, cen- 
tral tendency, and outliers. For example, rare genetic or medical conditions 
can cause a small percentage of the human population to be very tall or very 
short. Persons diagnosed with gigantism^ may reach adult heights of more 
than 8 feet, whereas persons with dwarfism are commonly less than 4 feet, 
10 inches tall. 
Because the heights of "average" people are statistically determined by 
excluding individuals with these rare conditions, the physical dimensions of 
tall or short people are therefore deemed "disproportionate" or "outside the 
average." Yet if the sampling set included only individuals with these special 
conditions, and excluded everyone else, then their statures would be con- 
sidered well within average. Hence, what is considered average depends on 
the sampling and calculation methods by which it is derived. 
Many consumer products are built for "average" people—they are con- 
structed for persons within an average height and weight range and who are 
not physically challenged. Such construction can cause difficulties for those 
who are not "average." As a result, some manufacturers offer products to 
help people make the necessary adjustments. For example, some people 
could not drive automobiles comfortably without enhancements like ad- 
justable foot pedals, which bring the brake and accelerator pedals closer or 
farther away from drivers. This allows shorter and taller people to drive 
more easily, keeping a safe distance from the car's steering wheel airbag. 
Gadgets also exist to help disabled drivers, including hand controls that can 
be used to brake or accelerate. 
Allometry. Another mathematical principle known as allometry (from the 
Greek word alloios, which means different) is especially important in the 
study of how humans grow. Biological allometry and human anatomy are 
concerned with the different growth rates that an organism experiences 
throughout its lifetime. A human infant does not have the same proportions 
of limb-to-head-to-body ratios as a human adult. The head of an infant com- 
pared to its body size is much different from an adult's. As a human grows, 
limbs and body size increase considerably while the head does not. This 
change in ratio occurs in all kinds of animals. A baby horse is born with ex- 
traordinarily long legs compared to its body. As it grows, the body catches 
up with the legs. 
An entire branch of science deals with the allometric changes of or- 
ganisms. One of the modern methods of observing allometric change is to 
Human Body 
place imaginary points on the organism, in this case, a human infant's head. 
A computer scans for the imaginary points and constructs a grid system. As 
the infant grows, these points are continually tracked, and the points shift 
in position relative to one another. When the infant reaches adulthood, it 
is possible to see how the skull grew, where it grew the fastest and the slow- 
est, and how the proportions have changed. The initial square grid looks 
wavy and distorted. Changes in body shape and physiology, such as in bone 
structure, breathing rate, and muscle strength can be expressed as variables 
and tracked. The basic allometric equations used to monitor these changes 
are as follows: 
? = a X xh and logy = log/? + b logr. 
This equation is used by biologists to plot two variables on logarithmic co- 
ordinates (using logarithmic scales on the x and ? axes of a Cartesian coor- 
dinate system). The result is a straight line. Many biological measurements 
that relate to change in body size use this general equation. The exponent 
b represents the slope of the line. This equation can help biologists track 
the changes in variables (the arbitrary points used to make an initial grid). 
Computers can track the three-dimensional C-D) changes that occur with 
growth and produce allometric 3-D scaling grids. 
How Much Should a Person Weigh? 
The new indicator used for weight measurements is the Body Mass Index 
(BMI). Formerly, weight-for-stature charts had been used when assessing 
weight. With this type of chart, a person's weight was evaluated only in re- 
lation to one variable, his or her height. When looking at a person's BMI, 
other factors, such as age, are considered. 
A BMI is the fraction of a person's weight divided by his height squared. 
If a person is between the range of 20-25, then he is said to fall within a 
healthy weight range. Once a person goes above a BMI of 25, he may suf- 
fer from weight-related health problems. Additionally, people with a BMI 
of less than 20 may also suffer health problems from being underweight. 
The BMI is the preferred way to chart weight because it looks at more vari- 
ables than how much a person weighs and what his height is. The body mass 
index can also help doctors be aware of people who may be more predis- 
posed to being either overweight or underweight. 
all growth charts are helpful in determining development, they 
really serve only as guidelines. There is no one correct height or weight for 
a person, only a range of what is healthy. Growth charts do not serve the 
purpose of locating an "ideal." Instead, they help to indicate whether some- 
one is healthy, see also Durer, Albrecht; Leonardo da Vinci; Loga- 
rithms; Ratio, Rate, and Proportion; Scale Drawings and Models.

Greek Philosopher and Mathematician 
370-415 c.e. 
Hypatia of Alexandria was a leading mathematician and philosopher of the 
ancient era. Her father, Theon, was the last known head of the Museum at 
Alexandria, Egypt, an ancient center of classical learning. He tutored Hy- 
patia and passed on to her his love of mathematics. Eventually her reputa- 
tion as a mathematician exceeded and outlasted his. 
Only fragments of Hypatia's work and a list of several titles of her trea- 
tises on mathematics remain. She translated and popularized the works of 
Greek mathematicians, including Diophantus's (third century) Arithmetical 
a book noted for integral solutions to linear equations, and Apollonius's 
Conic Sections. Hypatia also edited the Almagest, an important work by the 
Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy. She taught and 
wrote about a number of math topics on which farther progress was not 
made until centuries later. 
One of Hypatia's most eminent students, Synesius, wrote her letters ask- 
ing her advice on scientific matters, and these letters are one of the key 
sources about her work. He credits her with detailed knowledge of the as- 
trolabe and the hydroscope, as well as other devices used for studies in as- 
tronomy and physics. Historians living in her time praised her learning, as 
well as her beauty and character. 
Hypatia's ties to a politician who disagreed with Alexandria's Christian 
bishop led to Hypatia's death in 415 C.E., when she was murdered by a mob 
of religious fanatics. Following Hypatia's murder, many of her students mi- 
grated to Athens, which by 420 C.E. acquired a considerable reputation in 
mathematics. 
All of Hypatia's works are believed to have been lost in the seventh cen- 
tury, when the books of the library at Alexandria were burned by Arab in- 
vaders. SEE ALSO APOLLONIUS OF PeRGA.

IMAX Technology 
Ask anyone who has seen an IMAX film in an IMAX theater to describe 
their experience, and they will probably use words like "huge," "giant," and 
"awesome." This reaction is exactly what the designers of the IMAX film 
technology had in mind—a motion picture experience like no other. What 
exactly is it that makes IMAX films so different? 
IMAX's History 
In the late 1960s, filmmakers experimented with multiple-screen films. They 
used up to three cameras to film movies in a very wide format, which could 
then be played back to an audience using three projectors at three times the 
normal width. However, these systems had many problems. First, three cam- 
eras had to be used simultaneously to film the movie. Then the three pro- 
jectors that were used to show the film had to be perfectly aligned and 
synchronized. Another problem was that the edges of each projector's im- 
age tended to vary in brightness. 
Knowing that multiple-screen films were very popular with audiences, 
a group of Canadian filmmakers and business people decided to design a 
system that had the same large-scale effect as a multiple-screen film, but 
with a single camera and projector. After several years of work, the first 
IMAX film premiered at the 1970 World Expo in Osaka, Japan. The whole 
system was a hit, and since that time IMAX theaters have been built and are 
in use all over the world. 
The Characteristics of IMAX 
The magic of IMAX motion pictures stems from the combination of spe- 
cialized equipment that is used to film and project IMAX movies. Every part 
of the system has been developed especially for IMAX films. 
Screen Size. The first thing an IMAX theater patron is likely to notice is 
the screen size. The typical IMAX screen is about 50 feet tall and 70 feet 
wide. With this large screen, and the positioning of the seats in the theater, 
the screen fills even the peripheral vision of the audience. So when the 
camera moves, the audience experiences the sensation of movement. The 
sensation of motion can be made more spectacular when the film has been 
shot at high speeds, like from the cockpit of a jet fighter or from the front 
car on a roller coaster. 
peripheral vision the 
outer area of the visual 
field 
I MAX Technology 
A typical 45-minute large- 
format I MAX movie uses 
3 miles or 15,840 feet of 
film. Here a projectionist 
loads the film onto the 
large-scale reel. 
Some IMAX flat screens are as large as 100 feet high. Even more spec- 
tacular are IMAX dome screens. IMAX dome screens can be almost 90 feet 
in diameter. In the dome, the audience sits at a reclined angle so that spec- 
tators look up at an angle toward the center of the domed screen. Even in 
flat-screened IMAX theaters, the audience area is designed so that every seat 
has a full, unobstructed view of the screen. In an IMAX theater, patrons feel 
like they are in the movie, rather than just watching it. 
Sound System. Nearly everyone has experienced some sort of surround 
sound system in regular movie theaters, but IMAX theaters have sound sys- 
tems that are loud enough and spectacular enough to complement their 
unique visual experience. IMAX theaters have six-channel wrap-around 
sound systems. That means up to six different audio tracks can be channeled 
anywhere in the theater to give the audience the perception that not only 
are the images in motion, but so are the sounds. With up to 13,000 watts 
of power driving dozens of speakers, the sound systems are loud enough to 
recreate the concussion that is felt during a space shuttle launch. 
Film Size. Motion picture film is divided into frames. In the camera, the 
film is moved behind the lens and shutter and each frame is exposed for just 
a moment. When the film is developed and played back in a projector, the 
moving frames recreate the motion that was captured by the camera. 
The size of the film frame affects the quality of the image that is pro- 
duced. Standard motion picture film is 35 mm (millimeters) wide, and has 
a height of 4 perforations. The perforations are tiny holes on the edges of 
the film that the camera and projector use to move the film. High-quality 
motion picture film is 70 mm wide and has a height of 5 perforations. IMAX 
IMAX Technology 
film is even larger. It is 70 mm wide and has a height of 15 perforations. 
Additionally, IMAX film is run through cameras and projectors horizon- 
tally, so the perforations are at the top and bottom of the frame. Regular 
film is run through the cameras and projectors vertically, so the perfora- 
tions are on the sides of the frame. Because of its size, IMAX film is often 
referred to as 15/70 film. 
Special Cameras. IMAX movies are not just regular movies that have 
been printed on 15/70 film. The making of an IMAX movie begins with 
filming, during which special IMAX cameras use 15/70 film. The cameras 
weigh over 50 pounds apiece, and the film is loaded in cartridges that weigh 
about 5 pounds. Because of the speed of the IMAX film in the cameras, each 
film cartridge will provide only 5 to 7 minutes of footage. This makes for 
quite a bit of film reloading, or the use of multiple cameras. 
Mega Projectors. The projectors used to produce the unparalleled IMAX 
movie experience have been compared in size to a compact car. To begin, the 
film is loaded into the projector on reels that are the size of truck wheels. The 
reels are mounted horizontally on either side of the projector because IMAX 
film moves horizontally instead of vertically. The film itself moves through 
the projector in a unique way that is called a "rolling loop." Air is used to 
hold each frame momentarily on the rear of the lens, producing a picture that 
is far more steady and clear than a normal motion picture projector. 
To produce an image bright enough to light up the giant IMAX screens, 
the projectors use special xenon bulbs that consume up to 15,000 watts of 
power. This is equivalent to 150 100-watt light bulbs. With a bulb so bright, 
special measures must be taken to cool the projector. Both air, flowing at 
800 cubic feet per minute, and water, flowing at 5 gallons per minute, cool 
the bulb, which can have a surface temperature of 1,300° F. 
IMAX Movies 
Because of the expense and technical difficulties of filming IMAX movies, 
most of the 110 or so films that exist are short films, 40 minutes or less 
in length. Due to the spectacular visual quality of the IMAX format, many 
films are documentaries that are intended to show the audience images 
that are normally inaccessible. Consequently, the impact of the films about 
space exploration, wildlife, wilderness areas, or extreme environments is 
unforgettable. 
The IMAX film system is a remarkable experience for audiences all over 
the world. Since everything about the system is like a regular movie multi- 
plied by several factors, perhaps the adage "bigger is better" really applies 
to the IMAX system, see also Ratio, Rate, and Proportion.

DOES FILM SIZE MATTER? 
The area of an IMAX film 
frame—the area that is 
exposed—is over ten times 
larger than 35 mm (millimeter) 
film, and over three times larger 
than standard 70 mm film. This 
extra area makes the images 
sharper and more vibrant than 
other film formats. 
Induction 
Induction 
In mathematics, induction is a technique for proving certain types of math- 
ematical statements. The induction principle can be illustrated by arrang- 
ing a series of dominoes in a line. Suppose two facts are known about this 
line of dominoes. 
1. The first domino is knocked over. 
2. If one domino is knocked over, then the next domino is always 
knocked over. 
What can be concluded from these statements? If the first domino is knocked 
over, then the second domino is knocked over, which knocks over the third, 
fourth, fifth, and so on, until eventually all of the dominoes fall. 
Induction is a simple but powerful idea when applied to mathematical 
statements about positive integers. For example, consider the following 
statement: n2 > n for all positive integers, n. To prove that this statement 
is true using induction, it is necessary to prove two parts: first, that the state- 
ment is true for n = 1; and second, that if the statement is true for a posi- 
tive integer n = k, then it must be true for n = k + 1. Demonstrating both 
of these parts proves that the mathematical statement has to be true for all 
positive integers. 
Suppose using the induction principle it has been shown that n2 > n. It 
is then instructive to see how the statement is true for all positive integers, 
72. The first part says that n2 > n is true for n = 1, which is, in effect, knock- 
ing over the first domino. According to the second part, n2 > n is also true 
for n = k + 1 when it is true for n = k, so it is true for 1 + 1=2. This 
proves that the next domino is always knocked over. Now apply the second 
part again and take k = 2. Continuing this process proves that n2 > n is 
true for all positive integers. 
Using the induction principle, it can also be shown that 2n is always an 
even number for all positive integers, n. Substitute 1, 2, 3, and 4 for ? and 
the results are 2, 4, 6, and 8, which are all even numbers. But how can it be 
certain that, without fail, every positive integer n will result in an even num- 
ber for In} It looks obvious, but often what looks obvious is not necessar- 
ily a valid proof. The induction principle, however, provides a valid proof. 
The mathematical statement we want to prove is that 2 n is an even num- 
ber when n is a positive integer. To test the first part, we know that for n 
= 1, 2?? is 2 X I,or2. The first even number is 2. So the statement is true 
for n = 1. To test the second part, suppose that 2n is an even number for 
some positive integer n = k. Therefore, 2k is even. Remember, adding 2 to 
any even number always produces an even number. So 2k + 2 is also an 
even number, but 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1). Hence, 2(k + 1) is an even number. 
Assuming that the statement is true for n = k leads to the fact that the state- 
ment is true for n = k + 1. Therefore, the induction principle proves that 
2n is an even number for all positive integers, n. see also Proof.

Inequalities 
Inequalities 
An inequality is a mathematical statement that looks exactly like an equa- 
tion except that the equals sign is replaced with one of the five inequality 
symbols. 
? not equal to 
< less than 
< less than or equal to 
> greater than 
> greater than or equal to 
Imagine two friends of ages 9 and 12. Each of the five inequality sym- 
bols can be used to write a statement about their ages, depending on which 
aspect about their ages is to be emphasized. 
9 ? 12 says that 9 is not equal to 12 
9 < 12 says that 9 is less than 12 
9 < 12 says that 9 is less than or equal to 12 
12 > 9 says that 12 is greater than 9 
12 > 9 says that 12 is greater than or equal to 9 
Notice that 9 < 12 and 12 > 9 are two ways to represent the same relation- 
ship; when the 9 and 12 are reversed, the inequality is also reversed. 
The difference in meaning of "greater than" and "greater than or equal 
to" is subtle. For example, let a represent the age of a person. How would 
an equality be written to show that the age limit for voting is 18? 
The expression a > 18 means that the age has to be greater than 18. 
The expression a > 18 means that the age either can be greater than 18 or 
it can be equal to 18. Since a person who is exactly 18 years old is allowed 
to vote, the inequality a > 18 is the correct one to use for this situation. 
Various limits in society can be expressed using inequalities. Just a few 
examples are speed limits, minimum and maximum bank withdrawals, min- 
imum and maximum fluid levels, grade requirements for college admittance, 
and minimum sales to make a fundraising goal. Some common phrases that 
indicate inequality within word problems are "minimum," "maximum," "at 
most," "at least," and superlatives like "oldest" and "smallest." 
Solving Inequalities 
Every possible equation can be made into an inequality. Furthermore, in- 
equalities are solved the same way as equations, with one exception; namely, 
when an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number on both 
sides of the inequality sign. 
For example, start with the true statement 5 < 6. When both sides 
are multiplied by —2, the statement becomes —10 < —12. This resulting 
SUMMARIZING 
INEQUALITIES 
Two points must be remem- 
bered when dealing with 
inequalities. 
• If each side of an inequality 
is multiplied or divided by a 
positive number, then no 
changes are made to the 
inequality symbol. 
• If each side of an inequality 
is multiplied or divided by a 
negative number, then the 
equality symbol must be 
reversed.

statement is false because —10 is greater than — 12. Since multiplying (or 
dividing) an inequality by a negative number results in a false statement, 
the inequality symbol must be reversed to maintain a true statement. In 
this example, the correct answer is—10 >—12. As another example, to 
solve — 4x > 12, divide both sides by —4, and then reverse the inequality 
to yield x < — 3. 
A Practical Example. Consider the following problem. A student has 
saved $40, and wants to save a total of at least $300 to buy a new bicycle 
and bicycle gear. His job pays $7.25 an hour. Find the number of hours he 
needs to work in order to save at least $300. 
To solve this problem, let h be the number of hours he needs to work. 
The words "at least" indicate that the combination of savings and pay must 
be greater than or equal to $300. The solution below shows that the stu- 
dent must work 36 or more hours to meet his goal of saving $300. 
$40 + 7.25/; > $300 
7.25h > 260 
h > 35.9 
Graphing Inequalities 
Subtract 40 from each side. 
Divide each side by 7.25. 
The number lines in the top five rows of the boxed figure illustrate each 
case that may arise in graphing inequalities in one variable, x. A closed cir- 
cle on a number indicates that it is included in the solution set, and an open 
circle indicates that it is not included in the solution set. Shading to the 
left with a darkened arrow on the end indicates all numbers of lesser value 
are included in the solution set; shading to the right with a darkened ar- 
row on the end indicates all numbers of greater value are included in the 
solution set. 
Graphing Compound Inequalities. Compound inequalities are two in- 
equalities separated by the words "and" or "or." The solution set to a com- 
pound inequality that is separated by the word "and" is the region where 
the two graphs overlap. This is known as an intersection. 
Consider how to write a compound inequality that represents the pos- 
sible ages of a teenager, and then how to graph the solution set. To write 
this inequality, let a represent age. So a > 13 and a < 20. The graph of the 
intersection is shown in the sixth number line in the boxed figure. 
Compound inequalities that represent solutions that fall between two 
numbers are frequently written in an abbreviated notation with the variable 
in the middle. Hence, the inequality described above can also be written as 
13 < a < 20. 
The solution set to a compound inequality that is separated by the word 
"or" is the combination of all points on both graphs. This is known as a 
union. 
Consider how to write a compound inequality to represent the possi- 
ble ages of a sibling who is not a teenager, and then how to graph the so- 
lution set. 
Infinity 
To write this inequality, let a represent age. So a < 13 or a > 20. The 
graph of the union is shown in the seventh number line in the boxed figure. 
The corollary to compound inequalities in one variable is a system of 
inequalities in two variables. The solution to a system of inequalities is the 
intersection of the two graphs, just like the solution to a system of equa- 
tions. However, the intersection of a system of inequalities usually consists 
of a whole region of points. This is especially useful since real-world prob- 
lems often involve choosing from several possible solutions. 
Inequalities in Two Variables 
The graph below shows how to graph a linear inequality in two variables. 
Graphs in two variables are drawn using either a solid or dashed line. A solid 
line indicates that the points on the line are included in the solution set, and 
a dashed line indicates that the points on the line are not included in the 
solution set. For a linear graph, the solid or dashed line divides the plane 
into two regions, only one of which will be the solution set. 
Consider how to solve and graph ? + 7 > ?? + 8. First, subtract 7 from 
both sides to obtain ? > ?? + 1. Graph the equation ? = ?? + 1 using a 
dashed line. The dashed line divides the plane into two regions. Choose one 
point from each region that will be easy to substitute into the inequality. 
The points chosen below are @, 0) and @, 2). Only one of the two points 
will be a solution to the inequality, indicating which region includes the set 
of solutions. 
First, substitute @, 0). 
? > ?? + 1 
0 > C x 0) + 1 
0 > 1 (FALSE) 
Next, substitute @, 2). 
? > ?? + 1 
2 > C x 0) + 1 
2 > 1 (TRUE) 
Hence, the point @, 2) is a solution to the inequality. If more points in the 
same region are tested, they will also be solutions. Hence, the graph of the 
solution set includes points to the left of, but not including, the line ? = 
?? + 1, as shown above, see also Functions and Equations.

Infinity 
Few concepts in mathematics are more fascinating or confounding than in- 
finity. While mathematicians have a longstanding disagreement over its very 
definition, one can start with the notion that infinity (denoted by the sym- 
bol °°) is an unbounded number greater than all real numbers. 
Infinity 
Writing about infinity dates back to at least the Greek philosopher Aris- 
totle C84 B.C.E.-322 B.C.E.). He stated that infinities come in two varieties; 
actual infinities (of which he could find no examples) and potential infini- 
ties, which he taught were legitimate only as thought. Indeed, the German 
Karl Gauss A777-1855) once scolded a fellow mathematician for using the 
concept, stating that use of infinity "is never permitted in mathematics." 
The French mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes A595- 
1650) proposed that because "finite humans" are incapable of producing the 
concept of infinity, it must come to us by way of an infinite being; that is, 
Descartes saw the existence of the idea of infinity as an argument for the 
existence of God. English mathematician John Wallis A616-1703) sug- 
gested the use of °° as the symbol for infinity in 1655. Before that time, °° 
had sometimes been used in place of M A000) in Roman numerals. 
Defining Infinity 
Although students are typically taught that "one cannot divide by 0," it can 
be argued that — = 0 (read as "one divided by infinity"). How is this pos- 
sible? Observe the following progression. 
1 _ 
1 ~~ 
\ = 
\ = 
{ = 
1 _ 
16 ~ 
1.0 
0.5 
0.25 
0.125 
0.0625 
-~^ = 0.03125 
Note that as the denominator, or the divisor, becomes larger, the value of 
the fraction (or the "quotient") becomes smaller. What happens if the de- 
nominators become very large? 
¦jjj = 0.00195 
W = °-00024 
= 0.0000001 
One can see that as the denominator becomes extremely large, the fraction 
values approach 0. Indeed, if one thinks of infinity as "ultimately large," 
one can see that the value of the fraction will likewise be "ultimately small," 
or 0. Hence, one informal (but useful) way to define infinity is "the num- 
ber that 1 can be divided by to get 0." Actually, there is no need to use the 
number 1 as the numerator here; any number divided by infinity will pro- 
duce 0. 
Using algebra, one can come up with another definition of infinity. By 
transforming the following equation we see that infinity is what results if 1 
is divided by 0. 
Then 1 = oo x 0 
And oo = i 
Notice that this approach to informally defining infinity produces an equa- 
tion (the middle equation of the three above) in which something times 0 
Infinity 
does not give 0! Because of this difficulty, and because the rules of algebra 
used to write and transform the equations apply to numbers, some mathe- 
maticians claim that division by 0 should not be allowed because °° may not 
be a defined number. They argue that dividing by 0 does not give infinity, 
but rather that infinity is undefined. 
Another method of attempting to define infinity is to examine sets and 
their elements. If in counting the elements of a set one-by-one the count- 
ing never ends, the set can be said to be infinite. 
Infinity as a Slope. Infinity is also sometimes defined as "the slope of a 
vertical line on the coordinate plane." In coordinate geometry, it is ac- 
cepted that the slope of any straight line is defined as the change in verti- 
cal height divided by the change in horizontal distance between any two 
points on the line. The slope is often shown as a fraction in lowest terms, 
and sometimes called "rise over run." 
In the figure, the slope of line (a) is y. If a line is very steep, the rise 
will be very large compared to the run, giving a very large numerical slope. 
The slope of line (b) is -p A much steeper line will result in a fraction such 
as ——'-^—• Such a line would appear to be vertical, even though it would 
not be quite vertical if viewed in greater detail. Thus, the slope of extremely 
steep lines approaches infinity, and the slope of a "completely steep" line, 
that is, a vertical line, can be thought of as equal to infinity. 
Yet on a "completely steep" or vertical line, any two points give a run 
of 0. This means that one could define the slope of the line as any number 
over 0. This again allows the conclusion that division by 0 results in infin- 
ity, unless one maintains that the slope of a vertical line is undefined. 
The Nature of Infinity 
Although several definitions of infinity were provided, note that none of 
them state that infinity is the highest possible number. Consider this: On a 
number line, how many points are between points 4 and 5? An infinite num- 
ber, of course, because actual points have no dimension, even though their 
two-dimensional representations have a very small dimension on the paper, 
blackboard, or computer screen. But consider further: How many points are 
between points 4 and 6? Also an infinite number, certainly, but this set ap- 
pears to be twice as large as the one between points 4 and 5. This use of 
set theory as an approach to understanding infinity forces one to look at 
several curious possibilities. 
1. There are different sizes of infinity. 
2. A set with an infinite number of elements is the same size as one of 
its "smaller" subsets. 
3. Elements can be added to a set that already has an infinite number 
of elements. 
Which of these possibly contradictory statements is true? It may be im- 
possible to answer the question. Galileo A564-1642) felt that the second 
statement was true. The great German mathematician and founder of set 
theory Georg Cantor A845-1918) added to our understanding of infinity 
by choosing not to see the statements as contradictions at all, but to accept 
them as simultaneous truths. Cantor defined orders of infinity. An infinite

of irrational numbers.

bers is the smallest infinite set, called aleph null. Other larger infinite sets 
are called aleph one, aleph two, and so on. One can see that working with 
infinity produces various counterintuitive and even paradoxical results; this 
is why it is such an interesting concept. 
There are numerous examples of infinity in pre-college mathematics. 
One case: it is accepted that 0.999. . . is exactly equal to 1.0. Yet how can a 
number which has a 0 in the units place be exactly equal to a number with 
a one in that place? The idea that there are an infinite number of nines in 
the first number allows us to make sense of the proposition. The number 
0.999. . . is said to "converge on 1," meaning that 0.999. . . becomes 1 when 
the infinite number of nines is considered. 
Another example of how infinity comes into play in common mathe- 
matics is in the decimal representation of ?? (pi), or 3.14159. . . . The dig- 
its making up ?? go on forever without any pattern, even though the size of 
?? never gets even as large as 3.15. 
No one has ever come across an infinite number of real things. Infin- 
ity remains a concept, brought to life only by the imagination, see also 
Descartes, and His Coordinate System; Division by Zero; Limit.

Insurance Agent 
Insurance agents use 
computers and mathe- 
matics to assess risk, 
determine premiums, and 
calculate the amount of 
claims. 
Insurance agents help people buy insurance plans to protect against illness, 
accidents, or emergencies. The three major categories of insurance are life, 
health, and property. Insurance agents may be self-employed or they may 
work for a particular insurance company. Insurance agents work for indi- 
viduals or for companies to select an insurance provider, fill out complex 
application forms, and maintain records. In the event of a loss, agents help 
their clients settle insurance claims. 
Most companies prefer to hire insurance agents who have college de- 
grees. Insurance agents often have bachelor's degrees in business or eco- 
nomics. However, some companies will hire a person without a college 
degree if that person has proven sales ability or success in other types of 
work. 
The mathematics of insurance can be very complicated. Computers 
help insurance companies use statistics to estimate the probability of an 
Integral 
event occurring. For example, the odds of an individual being involved in 
an automobile accident vary depending upon the driver's age, sex, driving 
history, location, and type or style of car. These statistics are used to de- 
termine appropriate rates for insurance plans. The riskier a person appears, 
based on the statistics, the higher the rate he or she will have to pay for 
insurance. Computers make it easier and faster to process insurance appli- 
cation forms and service requests. 
Mathematics is used in the insurance business in other ways. For group 
coverage, insurance agents have to calculate the total cost, based on the num- 
ber of persons being covered. Also, discounts may apply to the policy, 
thereby yielding some percentage off the normal cost. Most importantly to 
an insurance agent, the agent's pay, or commission, is often a percentage of 
the dollar amount of the policy sold, see also Probability, Theoretical; 
Statistical Analysis.

Integers 
Integers are the set of numbers {. . . , —4, — 3, —2, — 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} 
that encompass the counting numbers, {1, 2, 3, . . .}, the negative of the 
counting numbers, {. . . —3, —2, —1} and zero. Integers can be shown on a 
simple number line. 
The integers on the left side of zero @) are called negative numbers, 
and are represented by a negative sign (—) placed before them, as in —5, 
—10, and —15.^ The integers on the right side of 0 are called positive num- 
bers. Examples include 5, 10, and 15. The positive integers are known as 
counting numbers or natural numbers. The positive integers and 0 are called 
whole numbers. Zero is an integer but it is neither positive nor negative. 
Integers are used in everyday life. A debt or a loss is often expressed 
with a negative integer. A gain is usually expressed with a positive integer. 
When the temperature is warmer than the zero point of the temperature 
scale, it is represented with a positive sign; when it is colder than the zero 
point, it is represented with a negative sign, see also Numbers, Real; Num- 
bers, Whole; Zero.

Interest 
When you borrow money to buy a car or a house you are not only expected 
to pay back that money, but to pay interest on it, too. Interest is a fee paid 
by a borrower to the lender for the use of money. It is calculated as a per- 
centage of the loan amount. When you deposit money into a savings ac- 
count or certificate of deposit or buy a savings bond, you are loaning money 
and so you are paid interest. Interest plays an important role in econom- 
ics because it serves as an incentive for those with available money to lend 
it to those needing it. There are many different ways that this fee is ex- 
pressed and calculated. 
Types of Interest 
The term "simple interest" refers to a percentage of the loan that must be 
paid back in addition to the original loan. For example, if you borrow $1,000 
at 10 percent simple interest and pay it back five years later, you will pay 
back the $1,000 plus 10 percent or $100 additional dollars for each year, a 
total of $500 in interest. 
Few loans, however, are actually based on simple interest. Loans are 
usually based on "compound interest," where the total of the outstanding 
original money and the accumulated interest are calculated on a regular ba- 
sis to compute the interest owed. In the preceding example, if interest were 
to be compounded annually (i.e., once each year), the interest for the first 
year would still be $100. But in the second year the borrower would owe 
interest not just on the original $1,000, but on the additional $100 of in- 
terest that was owed to the lender for the first year. The total interest for 
the second year would be $110. Similarly in the third year the interest would 
grow to $121. By the end of 5 years the total interest, compounded annu- 
ally, would be $610.51, in contrast to the $500 in simple interest. This is il- 
lustrated in part (a) of the table. 
"Discount interest" is interest that is subtracted from the loan when it 
is first made. Following the above examples, if you borrowed $1,000 at a 
discount interest rate of 10 percent, you would only receive $900, but would 
be expected to pay back $1,000. Since in this case you have really only bor- 
rowed $900, which you end up paying $100 interest on, you are paying a 
higher rate of interest than with simple or compound interest. In this ex- 
ample, a 10 percent discount rate would be the same as an 11.11 percent 
compound rate. 
Compound interest is not necessarily compounded on an annual basis. 
By compounding interest more often the lender is able to get interest on 
interest. This can have a significant affect on the total earnings made on a 
savings deposit or other loan. One thousand dollars in a savings account 
paying 6 percent interest compounded annually would earn $60 in interest 
in one year. What if that same account were compounded monthly, as shown 
in part (b) of the table? Six percent is not earned each month. Instead, the 
annual rate of 6 is divided by the number of months, 12, giving a half per- 
cent per month. So, using the table, you will note that after the first month, 
the account earns $5. But during second month there is now $1,005 in the 
account. The extra $5 also earns interest. 
Interest 
You can see from part (b) of the table that you earn an extra $1.68 by 
compounding the same savings monthly. In this case the rate is still 6 per- 
cent, but the yield is 6.168 percent. The rate is sometimes called APR and 
the yield APY, for annual percentage rate and annual percentage yield, re- 
spectively. Note that if a bank offers you a yield of 6 percent they are ac- 
tually offering you a rate of less than 6 percent. When comparing interest 
rates, it is important that you do not confuse rates with yields. 
So if you get a little more for computing interest monthly, what would 
happen if you computed it daily? The 6 percent rate would be divided by 
the number of days in the year C65) and the result would be the interest 
for one day. While this is only about $0.16, that extra $0.16 starts to earn 
interest too. By the end of the year, this results in $61.83 in interest being 
earned in the account or the yield for a 6 percent APR savings account com- 
pounded daily, day in to day out, which is 6.183 percent. Although the in- 
terest could be computed over smaller intervals, the interest calculation is a 
function that approaches a limit. The limit is so closely approached at the 
daily compounded value that there is little to be gained by compounding 
the interest more than daily. 
Interest and Loans 
Loans such as automobile, credit cards, and home mortgage loans work in 
a similar fashion, with the bank serving as the lender. Automobile and mort- 
gage loans are generally fixed term, meaning that they are expected to be 
paid off completely at a set time in the future. Automobile loans are usually 
a 3- to 5-year term, while home mortgage loans can be for terms as long as 
30 years. These loans allow the consumer to buy these expensive items be- 
fore they have all of the money for them, and pay for them while they use 
them. The cost of this convenience, however, is the interest. Home mort- 
gage loans can also be either at a fixed rate, agreed to at the start of the 
loan, or can be variable-rate loans, where the interest rate can change. Al- 
though variable rate loans are generally offered at a lower percentage than 
fixed-rate loans, the borrower must face the risk that the interest rate could 
be adjusted and become higher than the rate that was offered for the fixed- 
rate loan. 
Credit card loans generally have a significantly higher interest rate and 
require a minimum payment each month. Borrowers frequently find that 
they make no progress in lowering their credit card debt because more credit 
is incurred as the outstanding balance is paid off. 
Credit cards are an extremely convenient but expensive financial tool, 
and many borrowers get into serious financial trouble when they let their 
credit card debt grow. For example, if you have a credit bard balance of 
$1,000, the interest on this balance will be $15 per month if the annual in- 
terest rate of the card is 18 percent. The minimum payment that the card 
issuer charges will be somewhat higher than the monthly interest charge, 
but not by much. For this example, assume a minimum payment of $50. By 
paying only the minimum required payment each month, and adding in- 
terest, your balance is not significantly reduced from month to month. At 
this rate it could take years to pay off your balance.

When a borrower pays off a loan such as a house mortgage or a car 
loan, they make a payment at regular intervals, usually monthly. Some of 
the payment pays the interest on the loan for that month. The rest is ap- 
plied to the current outstanding value of the loan and reduces it, so that the 
loan will be completely paid off at the agreed upon time. In the case of a 
30-year home loan, a borrower will find that the largest part of the monthly 
payment is applied to interest payments at first and a small amount is ap- 
plied to the balance of the loan, called the principal. The result is that af- 
ter a few years you still owe nearly the full loan amount. Slowly the borrower 
makes progress against the principal, until finally after 30 years the loan is 
paid off. 
For example, if a borrower borrows $100,000 on a 30-year mortgage at 
8 percent fixed rate, after one year the borrower will have paid $8,805.17, 
not including taxes or insurance, but will have only reduced the principal 
by $835.36 (the remaining $7,969.81 goes towards interest). It is valuable 
to realize that if the loan has no per-payment penalty, you can significantly 
reduce the total cost of the loan by making additional payments in the early 
years, as these additional payments apply completely to the loan principal. 
For example, if after the first year the borrower was able to pay back an ad- 
ditional $904, the loan would be paid off a full year earlier, avoiding the last 
year of payments totaling $8,805.17. In this way a few extra payments each 
year or a slightly higher monthly payment can significantly reduce the term 
on the loan and result in significant savings. 
By building a savings account that benefits from compound interest, a 
small investment will grow well over time. If a person who is 20 years old de- 
posits $100 monthly into a savings account that pays 7 percent interest, they

Interior Decorator 
Although the terms "interior decorator" and "interior designer" refer to 
different professions, they are often used interchangeably. Technically, an 
interior decorator focuses on a room's surface—its color and decor and the 
artistic arrangement of the objects within it. An interior designer is more 
of an architect, concerned with the design and structure of the room. Nev- 
ertheless, the two fields have merged, and anyone interested in a career in 
interior decorating needs the same kind of training and experience. In the 
United States, this begins with a 4- or 5-year degree program from a school 
accredited by the Foundation for Interior Design Education and Research. 
These programs typically include course work in interior design, art, ar- 
chitecture, and technology. After graduation and 2 years of work experi- 
ence, the aspiring interior decorator is qualified for the state licensing 
examination administered by the National Council for Interior Design 
Qualification. 
Internet 
As one prominent practitioner comments, being an interior decorator 
is "more than lingering over fabric swatches or doodling out designs." An 
interior decorator must know as much about business (including budget- 
ing), engineering principles, materials science, drafting, and building safety 
codes as about color and arrangement. The interior designer has to be able 
to take accurate measurements of room areas, angles, elevations, and the 
like. A critical skill is the ability to envision and make drawings to scale to 
ensure that furnishings and other objects fit in the space being decorated. 
It is also a good idea for designers to develop strong computer skills, espe- 
cially the ability to use CAD (computer-aided design) programs, see also 
Architect.

Internet 
For many people, a good deal of the day is spent online. The ability to send 
e-mail messages and "surf" the World Wide Web has already become 
matter-of-fact. But an amazing amount of technology and mathematics must 
occur for e-mail and Internet access to be successful. 
A Brief History of the Internet 
The general consensus is that the conception of the Internet occurred in 
the early 1960s as part of the Department of Defense's Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (ARPA), which was conceived and headed by J. C. R. Lick- 
lider from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The intent was to 
share supercomputers among researchers in the United States. 
Because computers in the 1960s were so large and expensive, it was im- 
portant to find a way for many people, often at different locations, to be 
able to use the same computer. By the end of the decade, ARPANET was 
developed to solve this problem, and in 1969 four universities—Stanford, 
University of California-Los Angeles, University of California-Santa Bar- 
bara, and the University of Utah—were the first to be successfully con- 
nected. 
The ARPANET was not available for commercial use until the late 
1970s. By 1981 there were 213 different hosts (central computers) available 
on the ARPANET, although many were completely incompatible with one 
another because each "spoke" a different language. Things were somewhat 
disjointed until Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf created ????? (Transfer Con- 
trol Protocol/Internet Protocol), which became the common language for 
all Internet communication. This transformed the disparate collection 
known as ARPANET into one cohesive group, the Internet. 
Even though the intent of the ARPANET and Internet was to allow re- 
searchers to share data and access remote computers, e-mail soon became 
the most popular application to communicate information. In the 30-plus 
Internet 
Vinton Cerf is the co- 
developer of the com- 
puter networking protocol, 
TCP/IP, which has 
become the common lan- 
guage for Internet com- 
munications. 
years since then, not much has changed. In an average week, approximately 
110 million people are online in the United States. If, on average, each of 
those people sends ten e-mails per week (a conservative estimate), then there 
are more than a billion e-mails sent every week. 
Traveling on the Internet 
Although e-mail is something that is often taken for granted, a great deal 
must happen for an e-mail message to go from one device to another. De- 
pending on its destination, an e-mail message's travel path can be either very 
short or very long. 
Sending e-mail is similar in some ways to sending a letter through reg- 
ular mail: there is a message, an address, and a system of carriers that de- 
termines the best way to deliver the mail. The biggest differences between 
sending e-mail and regular mail are the first and last steps. 
When an e-mail message is sent, it is first broken down into tiny chunks 
of data called "IP packets." This is accomplished by a mailing program (such 
as Outlook Express or Eudora) using the TCP Internet language. These 
packets are each "wrapped" in an electronic envelope containing web ad- 
dresses for both the sender and recipient. 
Next, the packets are sent independently through the Internet. It is 
possible that every single packet (and there can easily be hundreds of them) 
is sent on a different path. They may go through many levels of networks, 
computers, and communications lines before they reach their final desti- 
nation. 
The packets' journey begins within the Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
or network (AOL or MSN, for example), where the address on the en- 
velopes is examined. Addresses are broken into two parts: the recipient 
name and the domain name. For example, in an e-mail message sent to 
Internet 
John_Doe@msn.com, uJ°hn_Doe" is the recipient name and "msn.com" is 
the domain name. 
Based on the domain name, the router (a piece of equipment that de- 
termines the best path for the packets to take) will determine whether the 
packets remain on the network or need to be sent to a different router. If 
the former is the case, the packets are sent directly to the recipient's e-mail 
program and reassembled using TCP. 
If the recipient is on a different network, things get more complex. The 
packets are sent through the Internet, where an Internet router determines 
both where they need to go and the best path to get there. Decisions like 
these are made by problem-solving programs called algorithms, which find 
the optimal path for sending the packets. 
Each packet is sent from one network to another until it reaches its fi- 
nal destination. Because they determine where the packets should go, routers 
can be likened to different transportation stations within a huge trans- 
portation system containing buses, trains, and airplanes. To get from one 
part of the world to another, a message may have to go through several sta- 
tions and use multiple types of transportation. 
For example, assume that two travelers are both starting in New York 
City and heading for Los Angeles. They get separated and end up taking 
different modes of transport yet still end up at the same point. This is what 
happens to the packets when they make the trip from the originating com- 
puter to their eventual destination; that is, they can get separated and sent 
on different paths to their final destination. Routers determine the optimal 
path for each packet, depending on data traffic and other factors. 
The packets often arrive at the final destination at different times and 
in the wrong order. The recipient will not see an e-mail message until all 
of the packets arrive. They are then recombined in the correct order by 
the recipient's mail program, using TCP, into a message that the recipient 
can read. 
Connection Speed 
How quickly all of this occurs can be influenced by many factors, some 
within the control of the e-mail user and others beyond it. One factor that 
can be controlled is the way information is received and sent to and from 
the originating computer. Popular types of connections available in 2001 
are telephone modems, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), Cable, Tl and T3. 
Telephone modems are the earliest and slowest of the possible types of 
connections. In relation to the transportation metaphor used previously, they 
would be the buses. Under optimal conditions, one can download or upload 
information at rates of between 14 and 56 kbps (kilobits per second) with a 
modem. (One kilobit equals one thousand bits.) A bit is what makes up the 
data that are ^ 
Actual transmission speeds for modems tend to be much slower than 
the optimal speeds because there is a vast, constant stream of data being 
transferred back and forth. Compare this to driving on a highway. Even 
though the speed limit may be 65 miles per hour (mph), because of traffic 
and road conditions, one may need to drive less than 65 mph. On the In- 
ternet, it is almost always rush hour.

cedure used to solve a

^ Eight bits equals one 
byte, and one byte 
equals a single character 
(a letter or numeral). 
Internet 
bandwidth a range 
within a band of wave- 
lengths or frequencies 
Under perfect conditions, the 56,000 characters of data per second— 
which comes out to over 3 million characters per minute—that can down- 
loaded may sound like a lot of information, but it really is not. Most text 
messages (such as e-mail messages) are relatively small and will download 
quickly using a modem. Audio, video, or other multimedia files, however, 
cause more of a problem. These files can easily be upwards of 5 or 10 mil- 
lion bytes each, and thus use a much greater bandwidth. 
Faster alternatives to modems are now widely available. The most com- 
mon alternatives for home use are DSL and cable modems. DSL works 
through the phone line. Speeds for DSL tend to be in the range of 1.5 mbps 
(megabits per second). One megabit is equal to 1,000 kilobits. 
Cable modems, unlike DSL, have nothing to do with phone lines. Ca- 
ble modems transmit data using the cable that carries cable television sig- 
nals. They offer fast speeds of up to 6 mbps. Even though this is a very good 
speed, an ISP may limit the available bandwidth, which restricts the size of 
files that can be uploaded or downloaded. 
For large companies, universities, and the Internet Service Providers, 
speeds need to be high and bandwidths need to be enormous. Tl and T3 
lines, which are dedicated digital communication links provided by the tele- 
phone company, are used for this purpose. They typically carry traffic to 
and from private business networks and ISPs, and are not used in homes. 
Both T3 and Tl lines have their advantages in certain areas. With T3 
connections one can potentially access speeds of nearly 45 mbps, or some- 
where around one thousand times that of a modem. Transmission speeds 
for Tl lines are considerably slower, running at 1.5 mbps. The advantage 
of Tl is privacy. Tl connection lines are not shared with other users. In 
contrast, T3 connection lines (as well as modems, cable, and DSL) are 
shared. 
Consider the highway metaphor once again. Having a Tl line is like 
maintaining a private two-lane highway on which only certain people are 
allowed to drive. Having a T3 line is more like driving on a 4-lane auto- 
bahn (the highway system in Germany, where there is no speed limit), with 
three of the lanes clogged up with slow-moving trucks. On the autobahn 
the potential exists to go very fast, but the traffic often prevents drivers from 
reaching high speeds. So whether the Tl or T3 is more desirable depends 
on which is more valued—speed or privacy. 
When an e-mail message is sent, there is a very good possibility that 
the packets will encounter nearly all of these types of connections on their 
journeys—just like people can use planes, trains, and automobiles. The next 
time you hit the "send" button, think about all of the logical and mathe- 
matical operations that are about to happen, see also Computers and the 
Binary System; Internet Data, Reliability of; Numbers, Massive.

Internet Data, Reliability of 
The Internet can be a wonderful resource for all types of information in- 
cluding quantitative data. The Internet is accessible, both for those who 
want to obtain information and for those who want to make data available. 
Since there is so much readily accessible information, Internet users must 
learn to filter the data they find on the World Wide Web, because the 
providers of information may misuse numbers and mathematics in order to 
appear convincing. Therefore, Internet users should learn to evaluate data 
carefully, critically, and even skeptically. 
To start, your local librarian could be of invaluable assistance in help- 
ing you discriminate between useful Internet sources of information and 
those web sites that would be a waste of time to visit. Remember that any- 
one can publish a web page on the Internet, and many web sites may be of 
little value in a search for specific quantitative information. Many librari- 
ans, particularly reference librarians, are specialists trained to effectively and 
efficiently search and obtain information for library patrons. The informa- 
tion specialist at your local library can save you significant time in your 
search for valid and reliable Internet data. 
Filtering Information through the URL 
Because the Internet is such a vast source of information of varying quality, 
web resources must be evaluated for authority, reliability, objectivity, accu- 
quantitative of, relating 
to, or expressible in 
terms of quantity 
World Wide Web the 
part of the Internet 
allowing users to exam- 
ine graphic "web" pages 
Users of the Internet and 
its World Wide Web must 
think critically about the 
information they find. Sta- 
tistics may appear author- 
itative, but their reliability 
can vary widely depending 
on their source. 
Internet Data, Reliability of 
racy, and currency. More traditional sources of information, such as an ar- 
ticle in an encyclopedia, are screened with all those criteria in mind by au- 
thors, reviewers, editors, and publishers. That is not the case for most of 
the information on the Internet. No one has to approve the content of web 
sites, so it is your job to assess the appropriateness of the data you find on 
the Internet. 
The domain name of the web page can reveal a great deal about the au- 
thority of the information on the web page. The domain name is the first 
part of the uniform resource locator (URL), and is the code that identifies 
the source of the web page. For example, of the address abc.com, the "abc" 
is the domain name. 
Agencies of the U.S. government are assigned the .gov suffix, so you 
can trust that most of the information on those web sites has been screened 
for accuracy. The .edu suffix is usually assigned to 4-year degree-granting 
institutions. Much of the information posted on these sites has been pre- 
pared by scholars. Remember, however, that students also can post infor- 
mation on academic web pages, and sometimes faculty members post 
controversial and biased information to support their position. Thus, infor- 
mation on university web pages should still be treated with skepticism. 
The .org domain suffix was originally meant for charities and non-profit 
organizations, a .com ending meant the site was for commercial businesses, 
and the .net suffix indicated the site is concerned with network issues. There 
are many sites with .com, .org, or .net suffixes that contain invaluable, reli- 
able, and accurate information, but remember that the people creating those 
sites have particular economic, social, or political purposes in establishing a 
web presence. There is great potential that the data presented on their web 
pages may not be as complete, accurate, and unbiased as you require. 
Web Pages with Authors 
Beyond the domain name, the authority of the web page can be ascertained 
from the page itself. The name of the author(s) should be clearly visible in 
the header or footer of the web page, with contact information (e-mail, 
phone number, and address) provided. If the author is affiliated with an or- 
ganization, this information should be clearly evident on the web page. You 
should scrutinize the author's education, experience, and reputation in the 
field you are investigating. That is easily accomplished by finding bio- 
graphical information, often linked to the web page, and by looking for ev- 
idence of peer-reviewed, scholarly work by the author. 
Closely connected to the authority of the web page is the reliability of 
the data found at that Internet site. Evidence that the information is reli- 
able can be determined by observing if the information presented on the 
web site is of a reputable author or organization, if the data are taken from 
books or sources subject to quality control processes, or if the site itself is 
an online journal that is refereed by editors or other experts in the field. 
Related to the reliability of the quantitative information obtained from 
a web page is the objectivity of the author. One of the purposes of a web 
site is for the author or organization to persuade viewers to adopt a partic- 
ular point of view, and sometimes this is done in a subtle and surreptitious 
manner. The bias manifests itself in the presentation of incomplete or, worse, 
Internet Data, Reliability of 
inaccurate quantitative information slanted toward the perspective of the au- 
thor. If the data look too good to be true, they probably are. Be wary of a 
hidden agenda, which can often be detected from the explicit or implicit 
purpose of the page. That purpose can only determined by careful and crit- 
ical viewing of the site. 
Looking at Information with a Skeptical Eye 
Finally, you can assess the accuracy and currency of information found at 
an Internet site by observing if the information is timely and comprehen- 
sive. The document should be dated, particularly if the subject information 
is known to change rapidly. Sites that have many outdated links are not well- 
maintained and probably are not current. Web pages that acknowledge op- 
posing points of view or are sponsored by non-commercial enterprises have 
a tendency to be more reliable. 
WTiile looking for data on the Internet, be aware that search engines 
do not evaluate web sites for the reliability or relevance of the information 
they contain. The various search engines have different algorithms for se- 
lecting sites, and those algorithms are generally not matched to your needs. 
For example, some search engines give priority to sites that are associated 
with sponsors of the search engine, and some give priority to the most pop- 
ular web pages. Although search engines do not evaluate the quality of web 
pages, "evaluative" web sites examine other sites based on quality of con- 
tent, authority, currency, and other useful criteria. 
Additionally, the lack of professionalism exhibited on the web page tells 
a great deal about the data contained on the page. The presence of spelling 
errors is an important indicator, as is the illogical organization of the site. 
Source documentation is extremely important, especially when it comes to 
the presentation of statistics and other quantitative information. The au- 
thors providing the Internet data should clearly identify the sources of the 
information they post, so that you can corroborate and confirm the valid- 
ity of the data. If the source of the data is not clearly explained or specified, 
the information should be suspect. If there are links to the source data, this 
is a very good sign that the information may be accurate and reliable. An- 
other positive indicator is the inclusion of a bibliography displaying related 
sources with proper attribution. 
As a general rule, you should challenge all of the information you find 
on the Internet. Information coming from reliable sources, such as those 
sites containing a .gov domain name or a respected author, does not require 
as stiff a scrutiny as information posted on a personal web page. Validate 
the information by finding other Internet sources or printed sources that 
support the information found on an Internet site. You should never use In- 
ternet information you cannot verify. Information is power, and in learning 
to become skeptical and critical readers and viewers of Internet data, you 
will obtain the power that comes with having accurate information, see 
also Internet.

Inverses 
SUMMARIZING INVERSES 
Inverses can be summarized in 
a few sentences. 
Additive inverses add to 0. 
The additive inverse of a 
number is the opposite of the 
number. The additive inverse of 
a positive number is a negative 
number. 
Multiplicative inverses multiply 
to 1. A number and its multi- 
plicative inverse are called reci- 
procals. The reciprocal of a 
number is 1 divided by that 
number. The reciprocal of a 
fraction is the same as the frac- 
tion flipped. 
The additive inverse of a number undoes the effect of adding that number. 
This means that, for example, the effect of adding a number by subtracting 
the same number can be undone. So, if 7 is added to 4, the result is 11. If 
7 is subtracted from 11, the addition is undone, and the result is 4. 
4 + 7 = 11 and 11 - 7 = 4 
Multiplication and division are related in the same way: They are in- 
verse operations that undo each other. If 6 is multiplied by 3, the result is 
18. Then 18 can be divided by 3 to undo the multiplication, and the result 
is 6. 
6 X 3 = 18 and 18 - 3 = 6 
Most mathematical operations have an inverse operation that undoes or 
reverses its effect. The squaring of a number, for example, as in 72 = 49, 
can be undone by taking the square root. The square root of 49 is 7. Thus, 
squaring and taking the square root are also inverse operations. 
Inverse operations can also be used to find the additive inverse of a spe- 
cific number. For example, — 9 is the additive inverse of 9 since the sum of 
— 9 and 9 is 0. Additive inverses come in pairs; 9 is the additive inverse of 
— 9, just as —9 is the additive inverse of 9. Any two numbers are additive 
inverses if they add up to 0. 
Visualize a pair of additive inverses on the number line. The number 9 
and its additive inverse —9 are both nine units away from 0 but on oppo- 
site sides of 0. For this reason, -9 is called the opposite of 9, and 9 is the 
opposite of —9. The opposite of a number may be positive or negative. 
The opposite of —4 is 4, a positive number. The opposite of 8 is —8, a 
negative number. The number —2 can be read as "the opposite of 2" or as 
"negative 2." 
A negative number is always to the left of 0 on a number line. Every 
number on the number line has an additive inverse. The additive inverse of 
0 is 0 because 0 + 0 = 0. 
Multiplicative inverses come in pairs also. Any two numbers are multi- 
plicative inverses if they multiply to 1. For example, because the product of 
3 and ? is 1, 3 and ? are multiplicative inverses. In the same way, ? and ? 
are multiplicative inverses because their product is 1. 
Decimal numbers also have inverses, of course. The decimal number 
0.04 can be written as the fraction ^, so the multiplicative inverse of 0.04 
is -^-, which equals 25. This can be checked by multiplying 0.04 and 25 to 
Inverses 
verify that the product is indeed 1. The additive inverse of 0.04 is —0.04 
because these two numbers add to 0. 
A pair of numbers that multiply to 1, such as ? and 3 or 0.04 and 25, 
are also called reciprocals. To find the reciprocal of any number, write 1 
over that number. Thus ? is the reciprocal of 3. One shortcut for find- 
ing the reciprocal of a fraction is to "flip" the fraction. The reciprocal of 
? is y; the reciprocal of -^ is -y. Pairs of reciprocals always multiply to 
give a product of 1. 
Every number on the number line, except 0, has a multiplicative inverse. 
The multiplicative inverse of 0, or the reciprocal of 0, is undefined because 
division by 0 is undefined, see also Integers; Mathematics, Definition 
of; Numbers, Real.

Knuth, Donald 
American Computer Scientist and Mathematician 
1938- 
Donald Ervin Knuth is considered one of the world's leading computer sci- 
entists and mathematicians. Yet in high school, Knuth found mathematics 
uninspiring. Although he achieved the highest grade-point average in the 
history of his high school, Knuth doubted his ability to succeed in college 
mathematics; and so did his advisor. So when Knuth graduated from high 
school in 1956, he entered the Case Institute of Technology (now Case 
Western Reserve) in Cleveland, Ohio, on a physics scholarship. 
In his freshman year, Knuth encountered Paul Guenther, a mathemat- 
ics professor who persuaded him to switch majors from physics to mathe- 
matics. Fearing he would fail, Knuth spent hours working out extra calculus 
problems, only to discover that his abilities far exceeded those of his class- 
mates. One particularly difficult professor assigned a special problem and 
offered an immediate "A" in the course to any student who could solve it. 
Although Knuth initially considered the problem unsolvable, he did not give 
up. Making another attempt one day, Knuth solved the problem, earned his 
"A," and skipped class for the rest of the semester. The following year, Knuth 
earned an "A" in abstract mathematics and was given the job of grading pa- 
pers for the very course he had skipped. 
Knuth graduated summa cum laude from Case in 1960 with a Bachelor 
of Science (B.S.) and Master of Science (M.S.) in mathematics. He went on 
to earn his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in mathematics from the Califor- 
nia Institute of Technology in 1963, and joined the faculty as an assistant 
professor of mathematics. In 1968 Knuth joined the faculty at Stanford Uni- 
versity, and served until his retirement in 1993, after which he was desig- 
nated Professor Emeritus of the Art of Computer Programming. 
Knuth's awards and honors include 17 books, more than 150 papers, 18 
honorary doctorates, the 1974 Turing Award, Stanford University's first 
chair in computer science, the 1979 National Medal of Science (which was 
presented by then-President Jimmy Carter), and the 1996 Kyoto Prize for

Russian Mathematician and Educator 
1850-1891 
Russian mathematician Sofya Kovalevsky was born in Moscow, Russia, the 
daughter of a minor nobleman. She became interested in mathematics at a 
very young age, when an uncle discussed mathematical concepts with her. 
Because of a wallpaper shortage, her nursery was papered with her father's 
lecture notes from a course in calculus, and at age 11 she studied the notes, 
recognizing principles her uncle had discussed. Under a tutor, she became 
so enamored with mathematics that she neglected her other studies. 
When her father stopped her mathematics lessons, Kovalevsky borrowed 
an algebra book and read it while the family slept. At age 14 she read a 
physics textbook written by a neighbor and taught herself trigonometry so 
that she could understand the optics section. The neighbor recognized her 
ability and persuaded her father to send her to St. Petersburg, Russia, to 
continue her education. 
Kovalevsky, Sofya 
Long, Hard Road to Success 
The story of Kovalevsky's adult life was one of doors closing in her face be- 
cause she was a woman. After finishing her secondary education, she arrived 
in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1869 to study mathematics and natural sciences, 
only to discover that the university did not admit women. Instead, she at- 
tended classes unofficially for three semesters. In 1870 she decided to try 
her fortunes at the University of Berlin. Again, the university did not admit 
women, but an eminent professor agreed to tutor her privately. By 1874 she 
had written papers on Abelian integrals and Saturn's rings. A third paper, 
on partial differential equations, was published in an influential mathemat- 
ics journal. On the recommendation of Kovalevsky's tutor, Germany's Uni- 
versity of Gottingen granted her a Ph.D. in 1874. 
Unable to get a job teaching mathematics, Kovalevsky returned home, 
where shortly after her arrival, her father died. In her grief she neglected 
mathematics for the next 6 years. Instead, she wrote fiction, theater reviews, 
and science articles for a newspaper. Later in her life, Kovalevsky would go 
on to write plays. 
In 1880 Kovalevsky resumed her study of mathematics. In 1882 she be- 
gan work on the refraction of light and published three papers on the sub- 
ject. Finally, in 1883 a door opened—she was granted a temporary 
appointment at the University of Stockholm in Sweden, where she taught 
courses in the latest mathematical topics. There she published a paper on 
crystals in 1885. She was appointed editor of a new journal, Ada Mathe- 
matics and organized conferences with leading mathematicians. 
In 1888 Kovalevsky entered a paper titled "On the Rotation of a Solid 
Body about a Fixed Point" in a competition sponsored by the French Acad- 
emy of Science. The committee thought so highly of the paper that it in- 
creased the prize money. In 1889 she won a prize from the Swedish Academy 
of Sciences for further work on the same topic and was elected as a corre- 
sponding member to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Russia. Later that 
year the university granted her status as a professor. 
Unfortunately, Kovalevsky's triumph did not last long. In 1891, at the 
summit of her career, she died of pneumonia in Stockholm. She was just 41 
years of age.

Landscape Architect 
According to the American Society of Landscape Architects, a landscape ar- 
chitect plans and designs the use, allocation, and arrangement of land and 
water resources through the creative application of biological, physical, 
mathematical, and social processes. While architects design buildings and 
structures, landscape architects are "architects of the land," designing parks, 
housing developments, zoos, waterfronts, and so on, as well as stormwater 
drainage systems, wetlands, and species habitats. Some of the specializations 
they pursue include regional landscape planning, urban planning, ecologi- 
cal planning and design, and historic preservation and reclamation. Forty- 
six states require landscape architects to be licensed by completing a 
bachelor's degree in the field and passing the Landscape Architect Regis- 
tration Examination. 
Among other skills, landscape architects must be sound mathematicians 
and be able to integrate mathematical models and planning methods into a 
technical design. To do this, it is necessary to take accurate measurements 
and compute areas, volumes, and the quantity of materials needed for each 
component of the job, all while staying within a budget. It is important for 
landscape architects to be competent with CAD (computer-aided design) 
software to help plan projects. Additionally, they need to understand the 
underlying mathematics principles in construction processes and support 
systems, as well as in methods of construction. For example, problems of 
drainage would require the landscape architect to manipulate contours and 
spot elevations, to calculate slopes, grades, and volumes of material, and to 
understand hydraulics, see also Architect.

Leonardo da Vinci 
LEONARDO'S ROBOT 
In 1495 Leonardo da Vinci 
designed a mechanical man 
capable of movement similar to 
humans'. Looking like a suit of 
armor, its inner workings are 
complete with pulleys, cables, 
and gears to make it move like 
the bones and muscles in the 
human body. 
Using the principles behind 
Leonardo's mechanical man, 
modern-day engineers have 
manufactured a new type of 
robot—the anthrobot. More 
human-like than other types of 
mechanical robots, anthrobots 
have greater flexibility, dexterity, 
and motion. The human-like 
movements of the anthrobot 
have made it an ideal choice for 
NASA's space exploration pro- 
gram and the construction of a 
space station. 
Leonardo da Vinci 
Italian Painter, Scientist, and Mathematician 
1452-1519 
Leonardo da Vinci was born in the Italian town of Vinci. As a young boy, 
he showed a talent for painting. When he was 20 years old, he joined the 
painters' guild in Florence. Within a few years, Leonardo's talent was known 
all across Europe. Although he completed only thirty paintings, two of 
them—the ???? Lisa and The Last Supper—are among the most easily rec- 
ognized paintings of all time. 
Leonardo was more than a painter: He was a scientist and mathemati- 
cian who explored botany, mechanics, astronomy, physics, biology, and op- 
tics. Leonardo developed prototypes of the modern helicopter, submarine, 
and parachute, and he attributed his scientific discoveries to mathematics. 
He wrote, "There is no certainty in science where mathematics cannot be 
applied." 
Although Leonardo dabbled in different areas of mathematics, geome- 
try was his chief focus. He discovered a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, 
dissected various geometric figures, and illustrated a book about geometry 
and art. At one point in Leonardo's life, a friend of his noted that "his math- 
ematics experiments have distracted him so much from his painting that he 
can no longer stand his paint brush." 
During the last three years of his life, Leonardo was a guest of Francois 
I, King of France. The king hoped Leonardo would produce some master- 
pieces for the royal court. He never did. Leonardo finished a few paintings 
he had already started and spent the rest of his time making scientific ex- 
plorations. He died in Amboise, France.

paintings, Leonardo da 
Vinci developed improve- 
ments to war imple- 
ments, such as this

Light 
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Other types of electromagnetic 
radiation include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and 
gamma rays. All electromagnetic waves possess energy. Moreover, electro- 
magnetic waves (including light) are produced by accelerated electric charges 
(such as electrons). Light moves through space in a wave that has an elec- 
tric part and a magnetic part. That is why it is called an electromagnetic 
wave. 
Speed of Light 
Light travels through empty space at a high speed, very close to 300,000 
kilometers per second (km/s). This number is a universal constant: it never 
changes. Since all measurements of the speed of light in a vacuum always 
produce exactly the same answer, the distance light travels in a certain 
amount of time is now defined as the standard unit of length. For conve- 
nience, the speed of light is usually written as the symbol, ? 
Characteristics of Waves 
All waves, including light waves, share certain characteristics: They travel 
through space at a certain speed, they have frequency, and they have wave- 
length. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves that pass a point 
in one second. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two 
corresponding points on the wave. There is a simple mathematical rela- 
tionship between these three quantities called the wave equation. If the fre- 
quency is denoted by the symbol / and the wavelength is denoted by the 
symbol ?, then the wave equation for electromagnetic waves is: 
c=fX. 
Since ? is a constant, this equation requires that a light wave with a shorter 
wavelength have a higher frequency. 
Waves also have amplitude. Amplitude is the "height" of the wave, or 
how "big" the wave is. The amplitude of a light wave determines how bright 
the light is. 
Wavelength and Color 
There is a simple way to remember the order of wavelengths of light from 
longest to shortest: ROY G. BIV. The letters stand for red, orange, yellow, 
green, blue, indigo, and violet. (This violet is not the same as the crayon 
color called violet, which is a shade of purple.) The human eye perceives 
different wavelengths of light as different colors. Red is the color of the

refraction the change 
in direction of a wave 
as it passes from one 
medium to another 
longest wavelength the human eye can detect; violet is the shortest. Red 
light has a wavelength of around 700 nanometers (nm). (A nanometer is 
one-billionth of a meter.) Light with a wavelength longer than 700 nm is 
called infrared. ("Infra" means "below.") Violet light is around 400 nm. Elec- 
tromagnetic radiation with a shorter wavelength is called ultraviolet. ("Ul- 
tra" means "beyond.") It is best not to use the terms "ultraviolet light" or 
"infrared light," for instance, because the word "light" should be applied 
only to wavelengths that the human eye can detect. 
Refraction and Lenses 
What happens when light encounters matter depends on the type of mate- 
rial. Glass, water, quartz, and other similar materials are transparent. Light 
passes through them. However, light slows down as it passes through a trans- 
parent material. This happens because the light is absorbed and reemitted 
by the atoms of the material. It takes a small amount of time for the atom 
to reemit the light, so the light slows down. In water, light travels around 
0.75c or 225,000 km/s. In glass, the speed is even slower, 0.67c. In diamond, 
light travels at less than half its speed in vacuum, 0.4k. 
When a beam of light passes from vacuum (or air) into glass, it slows 
down, but if the beam hits the glass at an angle, it does not all slow down 
at the same time. The edge of the beam that hits the glass first slows down 
first. This causes the beam to bend as it enters the glass. The change in di- 
rection of any wave as it passes from one material to another and speeds up 
or slows down is called refraction. Refraction causes water to appear to be 
shallower than it is in reality. Refraction causes a diamond to sparkle. 
Refraction is also what creates a mirage. Sometimes the air a few cen- 
timeters above the ground is much warmer than air a few meters farther up. 
As light from the sky passes into this warmer air, it speeds up and bends 
away from the ground. An observer may see light from the sky and be fooled 
into thinking that it is a lake. Sometimes, even trees and houses can be seen 
in the mirage, but they will appear upside down. 
Refraction of light allows a lens to perform its function. In a converg- 
ing lens, the center of the beam reaches the lens first and slows down first. 
This causes the beam to be bent toward the center of the lens. A parallel 
beam of light passing through a good-quality lens will be bent so that all 
the light arrives at a single point called the focal point. The distance from 
the lens to the focal point is called the focal length, f. A diverging lens 
spreads the beam out so that it appears to be coming from the focal point. 
In a slide projector, the lens projects an image of an object (the slide) 
onto a screen. The distance from the lens to the image and the distance of 
the lens to the object are related to the focal length by this strange-looking 
formula (di is the image distance and d0 is the object distance): 
Interpreting this formula is a little difficult. Remember that the focal length 
of the lens does not change, so — is a constant. If the image distance (dt) 
gets larger, the object distance (d0) must get smaller to make the fractions 
add to the same constant value. 
Light Speed 
Reflection and Mirrors 
When light hits a surface, it can also be reflected. Sometimes light is both 
refracted and reflected. If the object is opaque, however, the light will just 
be reflected. When light is reflected from a surface, it bounces off at the 
same angle to the surface. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of 
reflection, see also Vision, Measurement of.

Light Speed 
Many science fiction writers feel that humans will only be able to feasibly 
explore the Milky Way galaxy (and beyond) when it is possible to travel at, 
or above, the speed of light. Unmanned probes have already been sent to 
explore the solar system and beyond. NASA's Voyager land Voyager IIblasted 
off from Earth in the late 1970s to explore the outer planets and are now 
far beyond them. 
The Light-Year 
The dimensions of the universe are so enormous that they overwhelm con- 
ventional units of distance (such as the meter, kilometer, or mile). There- 
fore, a much larger unit distance is needed—the light-year. A light-year is 
the amount of distance that light travels in vacuum in one Earth year. As- 
tronomers have found light-years to be a convenient distance when mea- 
suring the distance between stars and other celestial bodies. 
In one second, light travels approximately 186,000 miles. To extend this 
out one year, multiply 186,000 miles times the number of seconds in a 
minute F0), times the number of minutes in an hour F0), times the num- 
ber of hours in a day B4), and times the number of days in a year C65). As 
a result, light travels approximately 5,865,696,000,000 (more than 5.8 tril- 
lion) miles in one year—the distance in one light-year. 
To better grasp the distance involved in traveling in outer space, imag- 
ine flying NASA's space shuttle from Los Angeles to New York City. This 
journey would take approximately 20 minutes at a speed of about 17,000 
mph (miles per hour). At that speed, a journey to the Sun would take about 
228 days. Beyond the Sun, the next closest stars to Earth are those of the 
triple star system of Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Cen- 
tauri at 4.3 light-years away, more than 25 trillion miles distant. This flight 
on the shuttle would take about 170,000 years! 
A voyage from Earth to the center of the galaxy, a distance of about 
30,000 light-years, would take about 1.2 billion years. Even the two Voyager 
spacecraft, the fastest machines ever launched from Earth, are now traveling 
Light Speed 
at only 10 miles per second, not even one ten-thousandth the speed of light. 
These spacecraft would take 78,000 years to reach the Alpha Centauri star 
cluster. 
As one can see, it would take extremely long periods of time to travel 
from Earth to other stars at conventional speeds, which is why the prospect 
of faster-than-light space travel has become so popular. It seems to be the 
only way to travel throughout the universe. 
Is Traveling at the Speed of Light Possible? 
Albert Einstein A879-1955) developed his special theory of relativity in 
1905. It declared that any material object can approach the speed of light, 
but it is impossible to go at or above this cosmic speed limit. The speed of 
light (denoted as c) in a vacuum—an approximation of what actually is found 
in interstellar space—is a fundamental constant of physics and nature. The 
speed of light is as basic as gravity, which Einstein tackled in his 1915 gen- 
eral theory of relativity. 
According to Einstein, if one could travel at the speed of light, then 
time would stretch to infinity and distances would be abolished altogether. 
Yet one obstacle to traveling at the speed of light is that matter attempting 
to attain light speed requires more and more energy but with very little re- 
sulting additional speed. At a speed above the speed of light, an object the- 
oretically would be going "backwards in time," an occurrence viewed by 
many scientists as impossible. 
Interstellar space travel appears to be extremely, if not prohibitively, ex- 
pensive, even if future technologies could make it possible. All the propul- 
sion systems proposed so far for faster-than-light voyages, such as warp 
drives, would require huge amounts of energy—more energy that is even 
conceivable to produce. On the one hand, there are many trivial ways in 
which things, in a sense, can be going faster than light, and there may be 
other more genuine possibilities. On the other hand, there are also good 
reasons to believe that real faster-than-light travel and communication will 
always be unachievable. 
Ways of Traveling Faster than the Speed of Light 
One way to (apparently) travel faster than light is to make light travel slower. 
Light in a vacuum travels at a speed c, which is a universal constant, but in 
a dense medium such as water or glass, light slows down to ^, where n is 
the refractive index of the medium (for instance, n = 1.0003 for air and 
72 = 1.4 for water). It is possible for particles to travel through air or water 
at faster than the speed of light in the medium. Therefore, going faster than 
the speed of light really means exceeding the speed of light in vacuum c, not 
in a medium such as air or water. 
Another way to (apparently) travel faster than light is to misrepresent 
speeds. If spaceship A is traveling away from a point at 0.1c in one direc- 
tion, and another spaceship ? is traveling away from the same point at 0.8 c 
in the opposite direction, then the total distance between A and ? may be 
thought to be increasing at 1.5 c (derived from 0.1c + 0.8c). However, this 
is not what is normally meant by relativistic speeds. 
The true speed of spaceship A relative to spaceship ? is the speed at 
which an observer in ? observes the distance from A to be increasing. The 
Light Speed 
two speeds must be added using the relativistic formula for addition of ve- 
locities: 
_ (« + v) 
W ~ A + uv/c2) 
where 
v = 0.7 c is the speed of spacecraft A, 
? = 0.8c is the speed of spacecraft ? and 
? is the speed of light. 
After inserting the appropriate values into the equation, the relative speed 
w is actually about 0.96c (that is, 0.96 times the speed of light) and, there- 
fore, not faster than the speed of light. 
Another way to (apparently) travel faster than light is to observe how 
fast a shadow can move. If you project a shadow of your finger using a 
nearby lamp onto a far away wall and then move your finger, the shadow 
will move much faster than your finger. It can actually move much faster 
than this if the wall is at some oblique angle. If the wall is very far away, 
the movement of the shadow will be delayed because of the time it takes 
light to get there, but its speed is still amplified by the same ratio. The 
speed of a shadow is therefore not restricted to being less than the speed 
of light. 
These are all examples of things that can go faster than light, but they 
are not physical (material) objects. It is not possible to send information on 
a shadow, so faster-than-light communication is not possible in this way. 
Faster-than-light travel cannot logically be deduced just because some 
"things" go faster-than-light or appear to do so. This is not what is meant 
by faster-than-light travel, although it shows how difficult it is to define 
what is really meant by traveling faster than the speed of light. 
Proposals for Faster-than-Light Travel 
One proposal for traveling faster than the speed of light is to use wormholes. 
A wormhole is a four-dimensional shortcut through space-time in which 
two regions of the universe are connected by a narrow passageway. The 
wormhole would permit matter/energy to proceed from one spot in the uni- 
verse to another in a shorter time than it would take light otherwise. Worm- 
holes are a feature of general relativity, but to create them it is necessary to 
change the topology (or the physical features) of space-time. 
The complete wormhole geometry consists of a black hole, a white hole, 
and two universe-regions connected at their horizons by a wormhole. Ac- 
cording to Einstein's theory of gravitation, empty space is actually a tightly 
woven fabric of space and time. Massive objects warp the space-time fabric, 
just as a bedsheet would be pushed down into a deep valley if a whale were 
to lie on it. Anything that comes near the valley naturally rolls in, and that 
"falling" is the force perceived as gravity. If the whale twists around on the 
bed, its motion carries the bedsheet along. 
If Einstein's theory is correct, space-time should likewise be dragged 
around massive objects. Black holes (like whales on a bedsheet) are objects 
that are so massive and dense that immense gravity warps space around the 
core, not allowing light or anything else to escape. A white hole, however, 
is a black hole running backward in time. Just as black holes (supposedly) 
pull things in, white holes (supposedly) push things out. This so-called

momentum 
naturally made warping of space in the form of wormholes could provide a 
means of quickly traveling to distant regions of space. 
A warp drive, sometimes called hyperspace drive, is a (theorized) mecha- 
nism for warping space-time in such a way that an object could move faster 
than light. The most famous spaceship to use warp drive (at least in science 
fiction) is Star Trek's U.S.S. Enterprise. Its concept expands space-time be- 
hind the spaceship and contracts space-time in front of the spaceship. The 
warp in space-time makes it possible for an object to go faster than light speed. 
But the problem with developing a warp drive is the same problem with 
formulating large wormholes. To construct it, one would need a ring of ex- 
otic negative energy wrapped around the spaceship. Even if such exotic mat- 
ter can exist, it is unclear how it could be deployed to make the warp drive 
work. 
A more likely scenario for deep-space travel makes use of Einstein's spe- 
cial theory of relativity. For objects moving at relativistic speeds (speeds near 
but below the speed of light), there is an observable stretching out of time 
relative to an observer in a stationary reference frame. For example, say a 
spacecraft travels at a constant speed of nine-tenths the speed of light @.9r) 
from Earth to Alpha Centauri, a distance of 4.3 light-years. According to 
time dilation, the time observed on Earth would be faster than the time 
onboard the spacecraft according to the equation 
where 
t* is the time indicated by the spacecraft clock, 
t is the time indicated by Earth's clock, and 
? is the speed of light. 
Therefore, according to Earth's clock, the spacecraft took 4.8 years to com- 
plete the trip D.3 light-years divided by 0.9r). However, onboard the space- 
craft, the journey takes only t* = 4.8{A — ( / )}1/2? or 2.1 years. 
A Future Reality 
With present technology, it is possible to (theoretically) produce spaceships 
that could slowly accelerate to near the speed of light so that a trip to the 
nearer stars would (in Earth time) take perhaps a few hundred years. How- 
ever, in the spaceship, the entire trip, due to time dilation, would perhaps 
take a few dozen years, depending on the time it took to accelerate up (and 
then accelerate down) to and from light speed and how closely to light speed 
the spacecraft traveled. 
It is rather difficult to define exactly what is really meant by faster-than- 
light travel and communication. Many things such as shadows can go faster 
than light speed but not in a useful way that can carry information. There 
are several serious possibilities for real faster-than-light mechanisms that have 
been proposed in the scientific literature, but technical difficulties still exist. 
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tends to stop the use of ap- 
parent faster-than-light quantum effects for sending information or matter. 
In genera] relativity there are potential means of faster-than-light travel, but 
they may be impossible to actually construct. It is highly unlikely that en- 
Limit 
gineers will be building spaceships with faster-than-light drives in the fore- 
seeable future. It is curious, however, that theoretical physics, as presently 
understood, seems to leave the door open to the possibility. 
Just because today something seems impossible, that does not mean that 
it will never become feasible, see also Cosmos; Einstein, Albert; Space 
Exploration; Universe.

Limit 
The concept of limit is an essential component of calculus. Limits are typ- 
ically the first idea of calculus that students study. Two fundamental con- 
cepts in calculus—the derivative and the integral—are based on the limit 
concept. Limits can be examined using three intuitive approaches: number 
sequences, functions, and geometric shapes. 
Number Sequences 
One way to examine limits is through a sequence of numbers. The follow- 
ing example shows a sequence of numbers in which the limit is 0. 
1 I 1 J_ J_ JL 
' 2' 4' 8' 16' 32' 64'"* 
The second number in the sequence, y, is the result of dividing the first 
number in the sequence, 1, by 2. The third number in the sequence, ^, is 
the result of dividing the second number in the sequence, y, by 2. 
This process of dividing each number by 2 to acquire the next number 
in the sequence is continued in order to acquire each of the remaining val- 
ues. The three dots indicate that the sequence does not end with the last 
number that appears in the list, but rather that the sequence continues in- 
finitely. 
If the sequence continues infinitely, the values in the sequence will get 
closer and closer to 0. The numbers in the sequence, however, will never 
actually take on the value of zero. The mathematical concept of approach- 
ing a value without reaching that value is referred to as the "limit concept." 
The value that is being approached is called the limit of the sequence. 
The limit of the sequence 1, y, {, {, ~, ~, ~, ... is 0.

Limit 
The example below displays several sequences and their limits. In each 
case, the values in the sequence are getting closer to their limit. 
Example 1: 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999, Limit: 1 
0.999999, 0.9999999, . . .

5.8400001, 5.84000001, . . . 
Example 3: -1, -y, -}, -{, -}, -{, -y, -}, -|, ~, . . .Limit: 0 
Not all sequences, however, have limits. The sequence 1,2,3,4... increases 
and does not approach a single value. Another example of a sequence that 
has no limit is —1.1, 2.2, —3.3, 4.4, —5.5, 6.6, .... Because there is no spe- 
cific number that this sequence approaches, the sequence has no limit. 
Functions 
Limits can also be examined using functions. An example of a function is 
f(x) = -. One way to examine the limit of a function is to list a sample of 
the values that comprise the function. The left-hand portion of the table 
can be used to examine the limit of the function ??) = - as x increases. 
As the values in the x column increase, the values in the f(x) column get 
closer to 0. The limit of a function is equal to the value that the f(x) col- 
umn approaches. The limit of the function/(r) = - as x approaches infin- 
ity is 0.

Limit 
Functions can also be plotted on a Cartesian plane. A graph of the 
function f{x) = — is shown in the figure. The color curve represents the 
function. As the x values increase, the color curve or thef(x) values get closer 
and closer to 0. Once again, the limit of the function/(r) = - as x goes to 
infinity is 0. 
It is important to consider what value x is approaching when deter- 
mining the limit off(x). If x were approaching 0 in the preceding example, 
f(x) would not have a limit. The reason for this can be understood using 
the middle and right-hand portions of the table. 
The table suggests that the values for/(?) continue to increase as x ap- 
proaches 0 from values that are greater than 0. The table also suggests that 
the values for f(x) continue to decrease as x approaches 0 from values that 
are less than 0. Because the/(r) values do not approach a specific value, the 
function/(r) = — does not have a limit as x approaches 0. 
Geometric Shapes 
A typical application of the limit concept is in finding area. For example, 
one method for estimating the area of a circle is to divide the circle into 
small triangles, as shown below, and summing the area of these triangles. 
The circle in (a) is divided into six triangles. If a better estimate of area is 
desired, the circle can be divided into smaller triangles as shown in (b). 
(a) 
If the exact area of the circle is needed, the number of triangles that di- 
vide the circle can be increased. The limit of sum of the area of these tri- 
angles, as the number of triangles approaches infinity, is equal to the standard 
formula for finding the area of a circle, A = ???2, where A is the area of the 
circle and r is its radius. 
In summary, limit refers to a mathematical concept in which numerical 
values get closer and closer to a given value or approaches that value. The 
value that is being approached is called the "limit." Limits can be used to 
understand the behavior of number sequences and functions. They can also 
be used to determine the area of geometric shapes. By extending the process 
that is used for finding the area of a geometric shape, the volume of geo- 
metric solids can also be found using the limit concept, see also Calcu- 
lus; Infinity.

Lines, Parallel and Perpendicular 
In mathematics, the term "straight line" is one of the few terms that is left 
undefined. However, most people are comfortable with this undefined con- 
cept, which can be modeled by a pencil, a stiff wire, the edge of a ruler, or 
even an uncooked piece of spaghetti. Mathematicians sometimes think of a 
line as a point moving forever through space. Lines can be curved or straight, 
but in this entry, only straight lines are considered. 
A line, in the language of mathematics, has only one dimension— 
length—and has no end. It stretches on forever in both directions, so that 
its length cannot be measured. When a line is modeled with a piece of 
spaghetti, a line segment is actually being represented. The model of a line 
segment has thickness (or width), while the idea that it models—a mathe- 
matical line—does not. So a mathematical line is a notion in one's mind, 
rather than a real object one can touch and feel, just as the notion of "two" 
is an idea in one's mind—that quality and meaning that is shared by two 
apples, two trucks, and the symbols //, 2, ©©, and ii. 
Think of two straight lines in a plane (another undefined term in geom- 
etry). Someone can model this idea, imperfectly, by two pencils or two pieces 
of spaghetti lying on a desktop. Now, mentally or on a desktop, push these 
lines around, still keeping them on the plane, and see the different ways two 
lines can be arranged. If these two lines meet or cross, they have one point 
in common. In the language of mathematics, the two lines intersect at one 
point, their point of intersection. If two lines are moved so that they coin- 
cide, or become one line, then they have all of their points in common. 
What other arrangements are possible for two lines in a plane? One can 
place them so that they do not coincide (that is, one can see that they are 
two separate lines), and yet they do not cross, and will never cross, no mat- 
ter how far they are extended. Two lines in the same plane, which have no 
point in common and will never meet, are called parallel lines. If one draws 
a grid, or coordinate system, on the plane, she can see that two parallel lines 
have the same slope, or steepness. Are there any parallel lines in nature, or 
in the human-made world? There are many models of parallel lines in the 
world we build: railroad tracks, the opposite sides of a picture frame, the 
lines at the corners of a room, fence posts. In nature, parallel lines are not 
quite so common, and the models are only approximate: tracks of an ani- 
mal in the snow, tree trunks in a forest, rays of sunlight. 
The only other possible arrangement for two lines in the plane is also 
modeled by a picture frame, or a piece of poster board. Two sides of a rec- 
tangle that are not parallel are perpendicular. Perpendicular lines meet, or 
intersect, at right angles, that is, the four angles formed are all equal. The 
first pair of lines in part (a) of the figure below meet to form four equal an- 
gles; they are perpendicular. The second pair in part (b) forms two larger 
angles and two smaller ones; they are not perpendicular. 
(a) 
(b) 
Lines, Skew 
Perpendicular lines occur everywhere in buildings and in other con- 
structions. Like parallel lines, they are less common in nature. On a coor- 
dinate system, two perpendicular lines (unless one of them is horizontal) 
have slopes that multiply to a product of-1; for example, if a line has a slope 
of 3, any line perpendicular to it will have a slope of -y. see also Lines, 
Skew; Slope.

Lines, Skew 
For geometric figures in a plane, two straight lines must either be parallel 
to one another or must intersect at one point. Skew lines are non-parallel 
and do not intersect. Skew lines must therefore lie in separate planes from 
one another. Since skew lines are defined in terms of distinct planes, dis- 
cussing such lines leads directly to the branch of mathematics called solid 
geometry. 
Solid geometry is the branch of Euclidian geometry (named for Euclid, 
? 325 B.C.E.-265 B.C.E.) that examines the relative positions, sizes, shapes, 
and other aspects of geometric figures that are not in a single plane. Whereas 
plane geometry is about two-dimensional space described by parameters 
such as length and width, solid geometry concerns itself with three-dimen- 
sional space. 
One example of a three-dimensional object is a cube, which has height, 
length, and width. Another familiar example of a solid (three-dimensional) 
figure is the pyramid. Figures like these can be used to illustrate skew lines.

The edges of the pyramid above form skew lines. Each of the four faces of 
the pyramid (as well as its bottom) define a unique plane. Line segments 
AB, AC, and ??, for instance, define a unique plane, and each plane con- 
stitutes one of the four faces of the pyramid. None of the three line seg- 
ments (AB, AC, ??) can be ske^v lines relative to one another because they 
all lie in the same plane. Recall that lines in the same plane either intersect 
(as do AB, AC, and ??) or are parallel to one another.

SKEW LINES AND 
HIGHWAYS 
Several of the lines formed by 
elevated roadways at a highway 
interchange skew to one 
another; that is, they neither 
intersect nor are parallel. How- 
ever, lampposts and overpass 
columns are vertical structures 
and, therefore, all of them must 
be parallel to one another. 
There are, however, several pairs of line segments on the pyramid that 
form skew lines. Line segments AB and CD form a pair of such lines. These 
two segments are skew to one another because they are neither parallel nor 
intersecting. Even if the line segments are extended into infinite lines, they 
still remain skew. Though some of the line segments are hidden from view 
in this picture, one can envision several other pairs of skew lines formed by 
the edges of the pyramid.

(extended) 
A cube possesses many combinations of parallel, perpendicular, and skew 
line segments. The cubes above illustrate different line pairs: parallel, per- 
pendicular, and skew. (The skew segments have been extended to indicate 
infinite lines.) The shortest distance between the two skew lines is the length 
of the dashed line segment, which is perpendicular to both of the indicated 
skew lines. Any other distance measured between the two skew lines will be 
longer than the dashed line segment. 
The spatial orientation of any two skew lines can be described by two 
quantities: the closest or perpendicular distance between the two lines, and 
the angle between them. The illustration below shows these two quantities 
of distance and angle. 
The two skew lines are A and B. Line ? lies along the intersection of 
the two shaded planes. The dotted line segment joining lines A and ? is 
perpendicular to both, and is the shortest distance between any two points 
on lines A and B. 
To find the angle between A and B, a line, Ap, is constructed, which is 
parallel to A and which also intersects line B. The angle between lines AP 
and ? is designated by the Greek letter alpha (a). Because Ap and A are par- 
allel lines, the angle a is also the angle between lines A and B. Therefore, 
by determining the distance (dotted line segment) and angle (a) between 
skew lines A and B, the relative position between the two is uniquely de- 
termined, see also Lines, Parallel and Perpendicular.

Locus 
Locus 
Sometimes it is useful in mathematics to describe the path that a point traces 
as it moves in a plane to meet certain conditions. For example, what is the 
path that a point on the end of the second hand of a clock traces in 60 sec- 
onds? This answer, of course, is a circle. 
One way to define a circle is to say that a circle is the locus of all the 
points in a plane that are a given distance from a fixed point, called the 
center. 
A locus in a plane can be thought of as all the possible locations or po- 
sitions that a point can take as it moves to meet certain stated conditions. 
What is the locus of, or path traced by, a point in a plane that moves so that 
it is always three inches from point A? This locus will be a circle, with point 
A as the center and a radius of three inches. 
\ATiat is the locus in a plane of all points that are 2 centimeters from a 
given line? This locus is made up of two lines, each parallel to the given 
line, one on each side, and at a distance of 2 centimeters from it, as illus- 
trated in the figure below. The two dashed lines form the locus.

\ATiat is the locus of all points in a plane that are the same distance from 
point D and from point E? To answer this, one might draw some example 
points that are equidistant from D and E, such as the points marked with 
a star in the left-hand illustration of the figure below.

are the same distance from D as they are from E is a line that is the

points such that the 
absolute value of the 
difference in distance 
from two points called 
foci is a constant 
perpendicular bisector of the line segment that joins D and E, as shown in 
the right-hand illustration. 
The idea of a locus can be used not just in a plane but also in three-di- 
mensional space. For example, the preceding example, extended into space, 
becomes the locus of all points that are equidistant from points D and E. 
This locus will be the entire plane that is perpendicular to the plane con- 
taining DE and its perpendicular bisector and that contains the entire per- 
pendicular bisector. 
In space, the locus of all points at a given distance from a specific point 
is a sphere with a center at the point and a radius equal to the given dis- 
tance. In space, the locus of all points at a given distance from a line seg- 
ment is a cylinder with a hemisphere at each end. 
The idea of locus can also be used to define the conic sections. In a 
plane, a circle is the locus of all points at a given distance from a specific 
point; a parabola is the locus of all points such that each point on the curve 
is the same distance from a specific point as its distance from a specific line; 
an ellipse is the locus of all points such that, for each point on the curve, 
the sum of the distances from each of two separate specific points, called 
the foci, remains the same; and a hyperbola is the locus of all points such 
that, for each point on the curve, the absolute value of the difference of the 
distances to each of two separate specific points, called the foci, remains the 
same, see also Conic Sections.

The logarithm of a positive real number x to the base-# is the number ? that 
satisfies the equation ay = x. In symbols, the logarithm of x to the base-^ is 
log^ x, and, if ay = x, then ? = log^ x. 
Essentially, the logarithm to base-^? is a function: To each positive real 
number x, the logarithm to base-# assigns x a number ? such that ay = x. 
For example, 102 = 100; therefore, log10 100 = 2. The logarithm of 100 to 
base-10 is 2, which is an elaborate name for the power of 10 that equals 
100. 
Any positive real number except 1 can be used as the base. However, 
the two most useful integer bases are 10 and 2. Base-2, also known as the 
binary system, is used in computer science because nearly all computers and 
calculators use base-2 for their internal calculations. Logarithms to the base- 
10 are called common logarithms. If the base is not specified, then base-10 
is assumed, in which case the notation is simplified to log x. 
Some examples of logarithms follow, 
log 1 = 0 because 10° = 1 
log 10 = 1 because 101 = 10 
log 100 = 2 because 102 = 100

log2 8 = 3 because 23 = 8 
log2 2 = 1 because 21 = 2 
log5 25 = 2 because 52 = 25 
log3 (|) = -2 because 3  = \ 
The logarithm of multiples of 10 follows a simple pattern: logarithm of 
1,000, 10,000, and so on to base-10 are 3, 4 and so on. Also, the logarithm 
of a number a to base-^ is always 1; that is, log^ a = 1 because a1 = a. 
Logarithms have some interesting and useful properties. Let x, y, and a 
be positive real numbers, with a not equal to 1. The following are five use- 
ful properties of logarithms. 
1. log^ (ay) = log^ x + logay, so log10 A5) = log10 3 + log10 5 
2- log, (p = bg^ x - \ogay, so log (}) = log 2 - log 3 
3. log^ xr = r log^ x, where r is any real number, so log 35 = 5 log 3 
4. log. ? = -log. *, so log ? = (-1) log 4 because \ = D) l 
5. log. ?? = r, so log10 ?3 = 3 
Logarithms are useful in simplifying tedious calculations because of these 
properties. 
History of Logarithms 
The beginning of logarithms is usually attributed to John Napier 
A550-1617), a Scottish amateur mathematician. Napier's interest in as- 
tronomy required him to do tedious calculations. With the use of logarithms, 
he developed ideas that shortened the time to do long and complex calcu- 
lations. However, his approach to logarithms was different from the form 
used today. 
Fortunately, a London professor, Henry Briggs A561-1630) became in- 
terested in the logarithm tables prepared by Napier. Briggs traveled to Scot- 
land to visit Napier and discuss his approach. They worked together to make 
improvements such as introducing base-10 logarithms. Later, Briggs devel- 
oped a table of logarithms that remained in common use until the advent 
of calculators and computers. Common logarithms are occasionally also 
called Briggsian logarithms, see also Powers and Exponents.

Lotteries, State

projects. State lotteries currently operate in about three-fourths of the states 
in the United States. These lotteries provide individuals with a relatively 
Lotteries, State 
inexpensive means of gambling on the possibility of winning a huge jack- 
pot. The first legal state lottery was established in New Hampshire in 1964, 
culminating 10 years of legislative effort. 
Probabilities of Winning 
A wide range of games is offered by the numerous state lotteries across the 
country. The offerings of the Florida State Lottery in 2001, for example, 
include Florida Lotto, Mega Money, Fantasy 5, Play 4, and CASH 3, as well 
as numerous instant games played with scratch-off tickets. These games cater 
to the preferences of potential players by varying the size of the prizes 
awarded and the probabilities of winning. 
Florida Lotto, the premier game in the Florida State Lottery, holds 
drawings twice a week. In this game, six balls are drawn from a container 
holding fifty-three balls numbered from 1 to 53. To win the jackpot, the six 
numbers chosen by a player must match the numbers on the six balls drawn. 
The order in which the numbers are selected does not matter. The Florida 
State Lottery claims that the odds of winning this jackpot are 1 in 22,957,480. 
Players can also win by matching five, four, or three numbers as well. The 
probability of matching five of six is 1 in 81,410, and continues to increase 
as the amount of matched numbers decreases. 
The probability of winning the jackpot in this game can be verified by 
determining the amount of six-number combinations possible or by multi- 
plying the probabilities of six consecutive successful selections. Calculating 
the number of combinations yields the following, which can be expressed 
using the notation of factorials, denoted as "!", 
E3!) _ E3X52X51X50X49X48) _ ?? Qr7 4?? 
[D7!)F!)] FX5X4X3X2X1) zz,y^/,^ou. 
Of these combinations, only one corresponds to selecting all six numbers 
correctly. Alternatively, using probabilities, you could multiply the proba- 
bilities that the numbers on a ticket are selected on each of the six succes- 
sive selections. The probability of the first number drawn matching one of 
the player's chosen numbers is 6 in 53. If this occurs, there are five favor- 
able numbers in the remaining fifty-two, and so on. Therefore, the proba- 
bility of six consecutive successful selections is (^?^?^??^?^?"^) 
or 1 in 22,957,480. 
Verifying the probability of correctly selecting five of the six numbers 
is only slightly more complex. Using the same logic as in the previous ex- 
ample, the probability of the first five matching numbers being selected on 
the first five draws is (^?^???????"?"^?)- If this occurs, there are forty-eight 
numbers remaining, and forty-seven are favorable to the result of correctly 
matching five of six numbers. Thus the probability of attaining this out- 
come would be (^X^X^X^X^X^)- Though the fractions being multi- 
plied would be different, the probability of the first number not matching 
and the next five matching would be (^?^?^??^?^?"^) which is equal 
to the previous result. It is easily verifiable that the probability of the non- 
matching number occurring on any of the six selections is equal. Thus the 
overall probability of correctly selecting five of six is 6(^X^X71X^X49X48 ) 
or 1 in 81,409.50355, which rounds to 1 in 81,410. 
Lotteries, State 
America's Largest \ 
tiore fun 
Though people do win 
large lottery jackpots with 
regularity, the odds of an 
individual winning the lot- 
tery are very slim. 
Fantasy 5 requires the player to match five numbers selected from 
26 numbers. Prizes are also awarded to those who correctly match three 
or four numbers. The probability calculations for this game are analo- 
gous to those of Florida Lotto. In Fantasy 5, the probabilities of match- 
ing five, four, or three numbers are 1 in 65,780, 1 in 627, and 1 in 32, 
respectively. 
At the other end of the spectrum is Florida's CASH 3 game. This game 
gives the player a probability of 1 in 1,000 of winning $500 on a $1 ticket 
or $250 on a 50-cent ticket. In order to win, the player must match a 3- 
digit number, each digit of which is a number from 0 to 9. In this game, 
unlike Lotto, each digit is randomly selected from its own set of numbers 
from 0 to 9 and the order of the result is important. 
The Mega Money game adds a bit of a twist. In this game the player 
picks four numbers from the thirty-two numbers on the top of the ticket 
and one number from thirty-two on the lower half of the ticket. In order 
to win, all four numbers on the upper portion and the number on the lower 
portion of the ticket must be drawn. Finding the probability of matching 
the first four numbers can be found in the same way as determining the 
jackpot probability in Lotto. In Mega Money, the probability is {-—) 
("??)("??")B9") = 1 'm 35,960. To determine the probability of winning the big 
prize in this game, you must multiply that result by the chances of cor- 
rectly matching the one number on the lower part of the ticket, which is 
drawn from another bin of thirty-two balls. The probability of winning the 
big prize, which averages $200,000 in this game, is: (^y^oX"^) = 1 
1,150,720.

Perspectives 
When there are no winners in a large game, like Florida Lotto, new tickets 
are sold for the next drawing, increasing the value of the prize. Some feel 
that if the jackpot has not hit several times in a row, that it is "due to be 
hit." In fact, the probability of any particular combination winning does not 
change. However, the increase in interest and, correspondingly, in the num- 
ber of tickets purchased makes it more likely that the jackpot will hit than 
if a smaller number of tickets were sold. 
Consider a hypothetical game in which the probability of winning the 
jackpot is 1 in 1,000,000. If the jackpot is relatively low and only 100,000 
tickets are sold, the probability of the jackpot being hit is at most 1 in 10. 
The probability is not necessarily equal to -^ since almost certainly, more 
than one person will have selected the same combination. Now assume the 
jackpot has not hit for several drawings and a huge prize has accrued. If 
more than a million tickets have been sold covering 900,000 of the possi- 
ble 1,000,000 combinations, the probability of the jackpot being hit will now 
be 90 percent. The chances of any individual ticket winning, however, re- 
mains 1 in 1,000,000. An interesting consequence here is that there is no 
guarantee that a winner will receive the entire jackpot. It is possible that 
two or more ticket holders will have chosen the correct combination of num- 
bers and would then divide the jackpot equally. 
Allocation of Revenue 
The potential revenue generated by a lottery has provided a strong incen- 
tive for states to pass legislation to legalize them. While the exact figures 
vary from state to state, normally about thirty to thirty-eight percent of the 
intake goes toward funding state programs. A little more than half is re- 
turned in prize money and the remainder is applied to various expenses as- 
sociated with operating the lottery, such as advertising and paying 
commissions to vendors. To put the monetary amounts from lotteries that 
go into state budgets into perspective, the New Hampshire state lottery pro- 
vided the state department of education with over $65 million in one fiscal 
year, bringing the total amount of aid to education in that state to $665 mil- 
lion. California boasts of more than $12 billion being earmarked for its pub- 
lic schools since 1985, while the New York state lottery provided $1.35 
billion to education in the 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
Prize Payoffs 
The allure of huge jackpots influences many individuals to purchase lottery 
tickets. Advertisements touting multi-million dollar jackpots are common. 
Information regarding the payoff procedures for jackpots is readily available 
from state lottery commissions as well as from other sources. Most lotter- 
ies allow the winner to choose between one immediate lump sum payment 
or yearly payments over a period of time. 
A jackpot winner in the California Super Lotto Plus, for example, can 
opt for an immediate payment of roughly half of the jackpot amount or can 
take payment annually for 26 years. In the long-term plan, the first install- 
ment is 2.5 percent of the jackpot amount. Successive yearly payments in- 
Lovelace, Ada Byron 
crease each year, with the final payment being about twice the initial. The 
sum of these twenty-six payments will be equal to the originally stated jack- 
pot amount. Thus the winner of a $6 million jackpot could take approxi- 
mately $3 million immediately or could get $150,000 as a first installment 
with successive yearly payments increasing each year and totaling $6 mil- 
lion after all the payments have been made. 
Of course, lottery winners must take into consideration the taxes that 
must be paid on their winnings. Calculating taxes at one-third, a $6 million 
jackpot winner choosing the one-time payment option would get approxi- 
mately $4 million. An individual may find that tax savings may be realized 
in the long term payoff; however, the large lump sum would not be avail- 
able for investing purposes, see also Probability, Experimental; Proba- 
bility, Theoretical.

Lovelace, Ada Byron 
English Mathematician and Scientist 
1815-1852 
Ada Lovelace was born Augusta Ada Byron, the daughter of the poet George 
Gordon (Lord Byron) and the mathematician and heiress Anne Isabella Mil- 
banke. Although Lovelace inherited poetic inclinations from her father, her 
mother raised her to be a mathematician, and she subsequently contributed 
significantly to the earliest work on mechanical computing machines. 
Lovelace received her early education at home and was assisted in her 
advanced studies by mathematician Augustus De Morgan and scientist Mary 
Somerville. Presented at court in 1833, she married William, eighth Lord 
of King, in 1835. He subsequently became Earl of Lovelace, and she be- 
came Countess of Lovelace. 
Although involved in London society, Lovelace was interested in math- 
ematics, particularly the calculating machines proposed by Charles Babbage, 
professor of mathematics at Cambridge. After Lovelace met Babbage, the 
pair became friends and coworkers. 
Babbage proposed mechanical devices—the Difference Engine in 1833 
and the more complex Analytical Engine in 1838—that would be able to 
make numerical calculations. Lovelace translated an Italian article describ- 
ing Babbage's Analytical Engine and added commentary that was three times 
the length of the original article. Published in 1843, this article clearly shows 
that she was the first person to understand fully the significance of Bab- 
bage's inventions. 
In the article, Lovelace described how the calculating machine could be 
programmed to compute Bernoulli numbers, foreshadowing modern com- 
puter programming. She also predicted the use of mechanical mathemati- 
cal devices for such purposes as music composition and the production of 
graphics. Although thought to be whimsical at the time, her predictions have 
turned out to be quite accurate, see also Babbage, Charles; Computers, 
Evolution of Electronic; Mathematical Devices, Mechanical. 
J. William Moncrief 
Ada Byron Lovelace is 
credited with writing the 
world's first computer 
program when she wrote 
instructions for Charles 
Babbage's Analytical 
Engine.
